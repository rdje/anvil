# COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION: construction-time coverage-feedback steering

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: `Usability / effectiveness — coverage-steered generation (north star, idea 6)`
- Created: `2026-06-17`
- Last updated: `2026-06-21`

## Goal

Find bugs faster by **biasing generation toward under-exercised constructs** —
but strictly at **construction time**, by adjusting the seeded construction-time
choices (the `roll_knob` decision sites), **never** by generate-then-filter. A
coverage target (which constructs/categories/surfaces to emphasize) and the
achieved coverage are both first-class, API-settable and API-queryable. This
turns ANVIL from uniform-random toward goal-directed exploration of the legal
design space while preserving every lane invariant.

## Non-Goals

- **No generate-then-filter / no post-hoc rejection** (`feedback_rules_first_generation`
  — the load-bearing doctrine). Steering biases the *construction-time* choice
  distribution; it never builds-then-discards.
- No behavioural oracle; coverage is over *structural* constructs (gate kinds,
  motifs, emission surfaces, hierarchy/identity features), not behaviour.
- No break to reproducibility: a given `(seed, knobs, steering-config)` stays
  byte-identical; default (no steering) is byte-identical to today.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A steering mechanism biases construction-time rolls toward a named coverage
  target and measurably shifts the achieved construct distribution vs. unsteered,
  on a seed sweep — while staying rules-first (no filtering) and reproducible.
- **API-completeness gate (decision `0017`):** the coverage **target** is
  settable via the MCP/config API and the **achieved coverage** is queryable via
  the MCP/introspection API (SCHEMA-DERIVED — projected from the existing
  metrics/knob-roll telemetry + the construct histograms). The CLI is a shim over
  the same surface.
- Default-off / DUT byte-identical (unsteered output unchanged); the byte-stable
  contract holds per `(seed, knobs, steering-config)`; downstream-clean.
- Documented in `book/src/algorithm.md` (or a steering subsection) +
  `book/src/agent-mcp.md` + USER_GUIDE; committed through `COMMIT.md`.

## Task Tree

- ID: `COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: `Construction-time coverage-feedback steering (rules-first, reproducible) with an API-settable coverage target + an API-queryable achieved-coverage readout.`
  Children: `COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION.1`

- ID: `COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION.1`
  Status: `done`
  Goal: `Design/decision leaf (ADR, no code): pin HOW coverage feedback biases construction WITHOUT generate-then-filter (e.g. per-category/per-surface weight multipliers applied to the existing roll_knob decision sites; or a deterministic schedule across a --count run that nudges weights toward under-hit constructs) while keeping byte-stability per (seed, knobs, steering-config); define the coverage-target model + the achieved-coverage readout (reuse knob_roll_attempts/fires + gate/category/surface histograms in Metrics); pin the MCP target-set + coverage-query surface (decision 0017); and EXPLICITLY reconcile with feedback_rules_first_generation (steering is a construction-time prior, not a post-hoc filter). Record as the next decision record + pre-split .2 (impl).`
  Acceptance: `A decision record + a tree/DEVELOPMENT_NOTES entry pinning the rules-first steering model, the reproducibility contract, the coverage target/readout, and the MCP surface; docs-only; INDEX + this tree + docs/TASK_TREE.md updated.`
  Verification: `done — decision 0023: the steering primitive is a deterministic per-category probability-prior MULTIPLIER on prob at the roll_knob site (effective_prob = clamp01(prob * weight), one gen_bool draw preserved) — rules-first (a construction-time prior, NOT a filter; no rejection path) and byte-stable per (seed, knobs, steering-config), byte-identical when unset (weight=1.0). Coverage-target = a SteeringConfig (KnobId / category → emphasis weight); achieved-coverage readout = SCHEMA-DERIVED from knob_roll_attempts/fires + histograms (zero new truth, decision 0011); feedback = an OUTER measure→derive→re-steer loop (not in-generator); API target-set + coverage-query per decision 0017. In-generator adaptive schedule + raw gen_bool/weighted-choice sites + behavioural coverage explicitly rejected/deferred. Pre-split .2a/.2b/.2c. INDEX + tree + TASK_TREE + DEVELOPMENT_NOTES updated; KM regen; docs-only / DUT byte-identical.`
  Commit: `COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION.1 — design ADR (decision 0023)`

- ID: `COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION.2`
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: `Implement the .1 design (decision 0023). Pre-split: .2a (the SteeringConfig + weight() lookup + the roll_knob prior multiplier + byte-identical-when-unset + distribution-shift + no-filter proofs), .2b (the SCHEMA-DERIVED achieved-coverage readout in --introspect + the MCP coverage query), .2c (the outer measure→derive→re-steer helper + book/USER_GUIDE/KM; close).`
  Acceptance: `set at .1 (decision 0023): a per-category prior multiplier at roll_knob that measurably shifts the achieved construct distribution vs unsteered on a seed sweep while staying rules-first (no filter path) and byte-stable per (seed, knobs, steering-config); unsteered default byte-identical; the coverage target settable + the achieved coverage queryable over the MCP/config API (CLI a shim); downstream-clean.`
  Verification: `pending`

  Children: `COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION.2a` (steering core), `.2b` (coverage readout + MCP query), `.2c` (outer loop + docs + close).

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION.1` | `done` | Design ADR (decision `0023`) pinned the rules-first steering primitive (a prior multiplier at `roll_knob`, not a filter), the byte-stability contract, the `SteeringConfig` target model, the SCHEMA-DERIVED achieved-coverage readout, the outer measure→derive→re-steer loop, and the decision-`0017` API surface. |
| 2 | `COVERAGE-STEERED-GENERATION.2a` | `pending` | First impl slice: the `SteeringConfig` + the `roll_knob` prior multiplier, with the byte-identical-when-unset + distribution-shift + no-filter proofs. Code; task-tree-owned. |

## Decisions

- `2026-06-17`: Registered as an owner-directed usability/effectiveness lane
  (idea 6). Binds decision [`0017`](../decisions/0017-api-first-everything-mcp-accessible.md)
  (API-settable target + API-queryable coverage) and is explicitly bounded by
  `feedback_rules_first_generation` (construction-time prior, never
  generate-then-filter). Design-first ADR before code.
- `2026-06-21` (`.1`): Design ADR landed as decision
  [`0023`](../decisions/0023-coverage-steered-generation.md): the steering
  primitive = a deterministic per-category probability-prior **multiplier** on
  `prob` at the `roll_knob` site (`effective_prob = clamp01(prob * weight)`, one
  `gen_bool` draw preserved) — rules-first (a construction-time prior, not a
  filter) and byte-stable per `(seed, knobs, steering-config)`, byte-identical
  when unset. Target = a `SteeringConfig` (per-`KnobId` / per-category emphasis
  weights); achieved-coverage readout = SCHEMA-DERIVED from
  `knob_roll_attempts`/`fires` + histograms (zero new truth); feedback = an
  **outer** measure→derive→re-steer loop. Pre-split `.2a`/`.2b`/`.2c`.

## Open Questions

- The steering primitive: per-roll weight multipliers vs. a deterministic
  per-`--count` schedule vs. a seeded distribution prior — which best biases
  construction while staying byte-stable per `(seed, knobs, steering-config)`.
  *(Resolved at `.1` / decision `0023`: a per-category probability-prior
  multiplier on `prob` at `roll_knob`, one draw preserved. The in-`--count`
  adaptive schedule is deferred to a follow-up `.N` — it couples units within a
  run; the outer measure→derive→re-steer loop gives the feedback benefit with a
  simpler reproducibility contract first.)*
- Whether steering targets categories, emission surfaces, or both, and how the
  target is expressed in the API. *(Resolved at `.1`: a `SteeringConfig` keyed by
  the existing `KnobId::name()` strings + a small fixed category taxonomy, settable
  via the `--config` JSON `steering` block + MCP + a `--steer` CLI shim.)*

## Implementation Notes (for `.2a` — captured during the `.1` design pass)

A pre-implementation code survey, recorded so `.2a` lands clean (continuity):

- **Single integration point.** All 31 steerable rolls funnel through one function,
  `roll_knob(g, m, knob, prob)` at `src/gen/cone.rs:42` (`g.rng.gen_bool(prob.min(1.0))`
  + `m.knob_rolls.record(knob, fired)`). `.2a` changes ONLY this function:
  `let w = g.cfg.steering.weight(knob); let eff = (prob * w).clamp(0.0, 1.0);` then
  `gen_bool(eff)`. No call site changes. For `prob ∈ [0,1]` and `w == 1.0`,
  `(prob*1.0).clamp(0,1) == prob` exactly (IEEE754) ⇒ byte-identical default
  (snapshots 6/6 prove it).
- **`SteeringConfig` type.** `per_knob: BTreeMap<String,f64>` (keyed by
  `KnobId::name()`) + `per_category: BTreeMap<String,f64>` + `weight(KnobId)->f64`
  (per-knob → per-category → `1.0`) + `is_empty()`. Add `KnobId::category()` next to
  `KnobId::name()` in `src/ir/types.rs` (suggested taxonomy: `state`, `selectors`,
  `datapath`, `terminals`, `sharing`, `hierarchy`).
- **Byte-identity of serialized outputs.** `config.rs` has **zero**
  `skip_serializing_if` today (every knob always serializes). Add the field as
  `#[serde(default, skip_serializing_if = "SteeringConfig::is_empty")]` so an empty
  steering block is OMITTED ⇒ `--dump-config` + `--introspect` stay byte-identical
  when unset, and the introspection schema version bump is deferred to `.2b` (the
  readout), per decision `0023`.
- **`Config::default`** is an explicit `impl Default for Config` at
  `src/config.rs:1012` — add the field there (default empty `SteeringConfig`).
- **Validation.** Add a non-negative-weight check (weights `>= 0.0`, finite) in the
  `Config` validation path (mirror the existing prob-range validation), returning a
  `ConfigError`.
- **Proofs.** (i) byte-identical-when-unset = existing `tests/snapshots.rs` 6/6
  untouched; (ii) distribution-shift = generate with a category up-weighted and
  assert `knob_roll_fires[knob]/attempts` rises vs unsteered on a fixed seed;
  (iii) no-filter = architectural (one `gen_bool` per roll, no rejection branch).
- **Gate.** `.2a` is a generator code change ⇒ run the full `COMMIT.md` gate
  (`cargo check --all-targets`, `cargo test`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D
  warnings`, `cargo fmt --all --check`); watch RAM per `0003-resource-safe-validation`.

## Blockers

- None. (Reuses the existing `knob_roll_attempts`/`fires` + histogram telemetry;
  the rules-first boundary is a design constraint, not a blocker.)

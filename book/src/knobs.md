# Knobs and Reproducibility

This chapter is the full catalog. You don't need to read it
top-to-bottom — it's organised as a reference. **Most users only
touch 2–4 knobs for their scenario.** The [Recipes](recipes.md)
chapter has ready-made combinations for common tasks; start
there if you just want a working command.

## Quick reference

The full catalog is below. This table is a scannable summary of
the knobs you're most likely to touch day-to-day:

| Knob                          | Default  | What it controls                                      |
|-------------------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `--seed`                      | 0        | RNG seed. Same seed + same knobs = identical output.  |
| `--count`                     | 1        | How many modules to generate in one run.              |
| `--min-inputs` / `--max-inputs` | 2 / 8  | Primary input port count range.                       |
| `--min-outputs` / `--max-outputs` | 1 / 4 | Primary output port count range.                     |
| `--min-width` / `--max-width` | 1 / 32   | Port and internal-wire width range.                   |
| `--max-depth`                 | 6        | Maximum cone recursion depth.                         |
| `--flop-prob`                 | 0.15     | Probability that a recursion point becomes a flop.    |
| `--share-prob`                | 0.3      | Probability of sharing an existing signal vs recursing. |
| `--construction-strategy`     | interleaved | How module logic is constructed (see below).     |
| `--factorization-level`       | e-graph  | Dial along the sharing chain: none / cse / operand-unique / commutative / associative / constant-fold / peephole / e-graph. |
| `--max-ast-instances`         | 1        | How many times one AST may be named (1 = strict CSE). |
| `--mux-arm-duplication-rate`  | 0.0      | Probability N-to-1 mux arms may share the same signal. |
| `--operand-duplication-rate`  | 0.0      | Probability `Add`/`Mul` operand lists may repeat (0.0 = strict). |
| `--trace <level>`             | none     | Generation trace: none / low / medium / high / debug. |
| `--metrics`                   | off      | Print per-module metrics JSON to stderr.              |

Everything else is available for fine control — see the categories
below. All knobs can also be set via a JSON file with `--config`,
and the effective merge of defaults + CLI overrides is printed by
`--dump-config`.

## Measurement doctrine

**No knob is privileged.** Every knob introduced in `anvil` is
subject to the same rule: its effect on generated output must be
empirically measurable, via the post-hoc metrics walker
(`src/metrics.rs`) and/or the live trace output (`--trace`). A
knob that exists but whose effect we cannot quantify is a knob
we cannot tell is working, redundant, or mis-specified.

Concretely, whenever a new knob lands:

1. A field in `Metrics` (or an existing metric) must capture the
   knob's intended effect.
2. The knob's section in this chapter must name the metric that
   measures it — see "Knob effectiveness map" at the bottom of
   the page.
3. A CLI spot-check (at default and at the boundary values 0.0 /
   1.0 / min / max) should show the metric shifting in the
   expected direction.

If none of the existing metrics captures the knob's effect, add
a metric. Landing a knob without its metric is a workflow
violation.

## Reproducibility

Every `anvil` invocation is deterministic in `(seed, knobs)`. The same
seed and same knobs produce byte-identical output, on any platform,
forever. This is non-negotiable.

Mechanism:

- One `ChaCha8Rng` instance, seeded once from the user-provided seed.
- All randomness flows from this RNG. No `thread_rng`. No system time.
  No floating-point ops that vary across platforms.
- Iteration order over hash maps is avoided in any path that affects
  output (use `BTreeMap` or sorted-`Vec` where iteration matters).
- The RNG is *not* sub-seeded per module — instead it is consumed
  serially. This means generating module N requires generating modules
  `0..N` first if you want exact reproduction. To reproduce a single
  module standalone, the manifest records its individual seed (derived
  from the master seed by a deterministic stream-position scheme).

## Knob taxonomy

Knobs fall into four categories:

### Structural knobs (shape)

Control the size and topology of generated modules.

- `min_inputs / max_inputs` — primary input port count range.
- `min_outputs / max_outputs` — primary output port count range.
- `min_width / max_width` — port and internal-wire width range.
- `max_depth` — maximum cone recursion depth.
- `max_nodes_per_module` — hard cap on node count; currently a safety
  ceiling, not hit in practice.
- `hierarchy_depth`, `num_leaf_modules`, `num_child_instances` —
  legacy exact depth-1 wrapper hierarchy controls (Phase 4).
- `min_hierarchy_depth`, `max_hierarchy_depth`,
  `min_child_instances_per_module`,
  `max_child_instances_per_module`, `child_instances_per_depth` —
  bounded recursive hierarchy controls (Phase 4).

### Sequential knobs (flops and mux motifs)

Control flop emission and D-input mux shape.

- `flop_prob` — per-non-leaf-node probability that a cone node becomes
  a flop. Default `0.15`.
- `max_flops_per_module` — hard cap on flops per module. Default `32`.
  Once hit, `build_cone` no longer considers the Flop branch.
- `min_mux_arms / max_mux_arms` — range for M, the number of mux arms
  on a flop's D input. Effective minimum is 2 (M=1 is excluded by
  design). Defaults `1, 4`.
- `flop_qfeedback_prob` — per-flop probability of the `QFeedback`
  kind (D = Q when no select fires) vs `ZeroDefault` (D = 0 when no
  select fires). Default `0.5`.
- `flop_mux_encoding_prob` — per-flop probability of the Encoded mux
  style (chained ternary over `Eq(sel, k)`) vs the OneHot style
  (OR-of-masked arms). Default `0.5`.
- `use_async_reset` — currently unused; flops are always async-reset
  by the single-CLK / single-RST_N discipline. Retained as a knob in
  case future work enables sync-reset as an option.

### Sharing knobs (tree vs DAG)

Control how often cone recursion terminates at an existing signal
instead of creating fresh logic.

- `share_prob` — per-operand probability of DAG-sharing (reuse an
  existing matching-width pool entry) at non-leaf decision points.
  Default `0.3`. See `sharing.md` for the tree-vs-DAG-per-recursion
  semantics.
- `terminal_reuse_prob` — probability of reusing a pool signal at
  forced-leaf decision points when a matching-width signal exists.
  `1.0` = always reuse that signal; `0.0` = never reuse it and emit a
  fresh constant instead. This is the leaf-level sharing knob; it is
  orthogonal to `share_prob`, which only applies at non-leaf
  recursion points.

### Construction strategy

- `construction_strategy` — which strategy the generator uses to
  construct a module's internal logic. Values:
  - `sequential`: per-output cone recursion in declaration order.
  - `shuffled`: per-output cone recursion in a random permutation.
  - `interleaved` (**default**): output cones interleaved via a global
    frame queue.
  - `graph-first`: deprecated alias for `interleaved`, retained for
    backward-compatible CLI/config parsing. The original speculative
    graph-first builder is retired.

  See `book/src/construction-strategies.md` for the full four-way
  comparison and rationale.
- `graph_first_pool_size` — legacy knob from the retired speculative
  graph-first builder. Retained for backward-compatible configs, but
  ignored by the current live interleaved/default path.

### Priority-encoder block

- `priority_encoder_prob` — per-emission probability of a priority-
  encoder block at a compatible target width. Default `0.05`. Skip
  the block (and fall through to the usual gate path) when no N in
  `[min_mux_arms, max_mux_arms]` yields `ceil_log2(N) == target_width`.
- N range reuses the block-level `min_mux_arms` / `max_mux_arms`.

### Case-mux block

- `case_mux_prob` — per-emission probability of a combinational
  `always_comb case (sel)` block. Default `0.05`. The block uses one
  encoded select bus, M data arms, and an explicit default-to-zero
  assignment.
- M (arm count) range reuses the block-level `min_mux_arms` /
  `max_mux_arms` knobs; select width is `ceil(log2(M))`.

### Casez-mux block

- `casez_mux_prob` — per-emission probability of a combinational
  `always_comb casez (sel)` block. Default `0.05`. The block uses one
  encoded select bus, M data arms, wildcard patterns, and an explicit
  default-to-zero assignment.
- Generation keeps the wildcard patterns non-overlapping by
  construction, so the surface stays a wildcarded mux motif rather than
  becoming an accidental priority chain.

### Bounded for-fold block

- `for_fold_prob` — per-emission probability of a combinational
  statically bounded `always_comb` `for`-fold block. Default `0.05`.
  The block takes one packed source bus, initializes an accumulator,
  and folds fixed-width chunks with a static trip count.
- The fold kind today is one of `xor`, `or`, `and`, or `add`.
- The trip-count range reuses `min_gate_arity` / `max_gate_arity`; the
  generated packed source width is `trip_count * chunk_width`.

### Combinational mux block

- `comb_mux_prob` — probability that a non-leaf recursion point
  becomes an M-to-1 combinational mux block (instead of an operator
  gate). Default `0.1`. Ordering: flop takes priority if it also
  rolls; comb mux takes priority over operator.
- `comb_mux_encoding_prob` — per-mux probability of the Encoded
  style (chained ternary over `Eq(sel, k)`, `ceil(log2(M))`-bit
  select bus) vs the OneHot style (M 1-bit select signals, OR of
  masked arms). Default `0.5`.
- M (arm count) range reuses the block-level `min_mux_arms` /
  `max_mux_arms` knobs (shared with flop D-muxes).
- No Q-feedback knob for comb muxes — they have no state.

### Coefficient motif (linear combinations)

- `coefficient_prob` — per-op probability (when `build_cone` picks
  `Add`, `Sub`, or `Mul`) of emitting the linear-combination
  compound form instead of a standard operator. Default `0.2`.
  Shapes: Add `y = Σ sᵢ·cᵢ`, Sub `y = s1·c1 − s2·c2 − … − sn·cn`,
  Mul `y = c · s1 · s2 · … · sn`. See
  `book/src/structural-rules.md` "Roles of constants in RTL".
- `min_coefficient / max_coefficient` — strictly-positive integer
  range for the drawn coefficients. Defaults `1, 15`.

### Shift-amount motif

- `const_shift_amount_prob` — per-shift probability that `Shl`/`Shr`
  emits `value << const` / `value >> const` (constant amount) instead
  of `value << signal` (barrel shifter). Default `0.8` — real designs
  overwhelmingly use constant amounts.
- `min_shift_amount / max_shift_amount` — range for the drawn
  constant shift amount, clamped to `[0, W-1]` for a W-bit value.
  Defaults `0, 7`.
- `gate_shift_weight` — relative weight for the shifts bucket (Shl,
  Shr) in `pick_gate`. Default `1`. Shifts are disabled at width 1.

### Comparand motif

- `const_comparand_prob` — per-comparison probability the RHS is a
  constant literal instead of a recursive signal cone. Additive to
  signal-vs-signal comparisons (the default remains signal-vs-signal
  when the coin doesn't fire). Default `0.3`. LHS is always a signal.
- `min_comparand / max_comparand` — range for the constant RHS,
  clamped to `[0, 2^K - 1]` for the chosen internal operand width K.
  Defaults `0, 255`.

### Operator N-arity

- `min_gate_arity / max_gate_arity` — range for N, the arity of
  associative operators (`And`, `Or`, `Xor`, `Add`, `Mul`) when they
  are picked by `build_cone`. Each operator emission draws
  `N = rand(min_gate_arity..=max_gate_arity)` independently.
  Defaults `2, 4`. `Sub` is strictly 2-arity (not associative) and
  is not affected by this range. See Rule 14 in
  `book/src/structural-rules.md`.

### Motif mix and termination

- `constant_prob` — probability of emitting a constant terminal when
  no matching-width signal exists but a dep-bearing width-adapter
  source does. Default `0.1`. When this misses, `pick_terminal`
  adapts an existing source instead of minting a constant.
- `gate_*_weight` — relative weights for gate categories when picking
  a gate at a non-leaf recursion point. Defaults bitwise `3`, arith
  `2`, struct `1`, compare `1`, reduce `1`.
- Termination: there is no explicit `leaf_prob_growth` knob —
  `build_cone` uses a linear `depth / max_depth` ramp, forcing a leaf
  at `max_depth`.

### AST uniqueness / duplication

- `identity_mode` — coarse NodeId semantics switch:
  - `node-id` (default): NodeId means expression identity, which
    implies full factorization by definition. The factorization ladder
    is the current build's enforcement/proof-depth dial inside that
    doctrine, including the bounded semantic gate merge at `e-graph`
    and the post-drain endpoint-aware flop merge.
  - `relaxed`: disable the ladder entirely; every
    `intern_gate` / `intern_constant` call allocates a fresh
    `NodeId` even if `factorization_level` requests more.
  This is orthogonal to construction strategy. See Rule 21c.

- `factorization_level` — current-build dial along the sharing chain:
  `none → cse → operand-unique → commutative → associative →
  constant-fold → peephole → e-graph`. Default `e-graph`
  (theoretical ceiling; activates every layer implemented today)
  when `identity_mode = node-id`. Each step implies all lower
  ones. Lower rungs are weaker enforcement of the same doctrine, not a
  different definition of `node-id`. Implemented layers land
  progressively without requiring a config change. See Rule 21c.

- `max_ast_instances` — maximum number of times a given AST
  (`(op, operands, width)` for gates, `(width, value)` for
  constants) may be materialised as a named node in one module.
  Default `1` = strict uniqueness (construction-time CSE). See
  Rule 21 in `book/src/structural-rules.md`. Values:
  - `1` (default): one AST = one node. No `eq_0` / `eq_9` computing
    the same thing.
  - `K > 1`: up to K copies of the same AST before callers are
    routed to the last-created instance.
  - `u32::MAX`: effectively disables dedup.

- `mux_arm_duplication_rate` — probability that an arm of an N-to-1
  mux may be connected to a data signal already used by another
  arm of the same mux. Range `[0.0, 1.0]`. Default `0.0` = all
  arms distinct (best-effort). `1.0` = no constraint. See Rule 22
  in `book/src/structural-rules.md`.

- `operand_duplication_rate` — probability that an operator gate's
  operand list may contain the same `NodeId` twice (applies to
  `Add` and `Mul`; `And`/`Or`/`Xor` are *always* strict regardless
  because duplicates collapse algebraically). Range `[0.0, 1.0]`.
  Default `0.0` = strict operand uniqueness for `Add`/`Mul`.
  `1.0` = duplicates unrestricted — opt in to exercise
  `x + x = 2x` / `x * x = x²` shapes in downstream tools. See
  `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 8 + Rule 21c.

### Hierarchy knobs (Phase 4+)

- `hierarchy_depth` — legacy exact hierarchy-depth knob. Today `0`
  keeps the leaf-only lane and `1` selects the legacy exact wrapper
  lane.
- `num_leaf_modules` — size of the pre-generated child library for the
  legacy exact depth-1 wrapper lane.
- `num_child_instances` — instantiated child count for the legacy exact
  depth-1 wrapper lane. Default `0` preserves the legacy exact-once
  behavior ("instantiate every generated leaf definition once"). Values
  below `num_leaf_modules` under-instantiate the library; larger values
  reuse child definitions.
- `min_hierarchy_depth`, `max_hierarchy_depth` — bounded recursive
  hierarchy depth range. In the current slice, ANVIL keeps every leaf
  depth inside `[min:max]` and can now mix shallow and deep branches in
  one tree when the interval is open and the structure allows it.
- `min_child_instances_per_module`,
  `max_child_instances_per_module` — bounded recursive child-instance
  range for each non-leaf module.
- `child_instances_per_depth` — optional repeated override keyed by
  parent depth (`DEPTH=MIN:MAX`). This layers on top of the bounded
  recursive fallback range, so depth `0` can be forced to one
  branching profile while depth `1` uses another.
- `hierarchy_child_source_mode` — explicit child-sourcing mode for both
  hierarchy lanes. `library` keeps a reusable child-definition pool.
  The current `on-demand` slice synthesizes one profiled child
  definition per planned instance slot against a parent-planned exact
  data-interface profile. Control ports stay structural and are not
  part of that profile.
- `hierarchy_sibling_route_prob` — probability that later child data
  inputs bind from earlier sibling instance outputs instead of always
  binding from parent-boundary inputs. Range `[0.0, 1.0]`. Default
  `0.35`. Direct sibling routing is combinational; registered routing
  can be exercised through the parent-local state knob below.
- `hierarchy_child_input_cone_prob` — probability that a child data
  input binds through a parent-local combinational cone instead of a
  direct parent-port or sibling-output route. The cone may use
  already-available parent sources: parent data inputs, earlier sibling
  instance outputs, and earlier parent-side route gates. Range
  `[0.0, 1.0]`. Default `0.35`.
- `hierarchy_parent_flop_prob` — probability that parent-side hierarchy
  cones may emit local parent flops. This applies to parent output
  cones and parent-composed child-input cones. Range `[0.0, 1.0]`.
  Default `0.0`, so hierarchy remains combinational unless state is
  explicitly requested.
- The legacy exact wrapper knobs and the bounded recursive range knobs
  are intentionally **mutually exclusive**. They are two different
  planning lanes, not shorthand for the same behavior.
- `library_prob` — internal future probabilistic dial for a later
  mixed-sourcing planner. It is not the current user-facing control
  surface; current HEAD uses the explicit
  `hierarchy_child_source_mode` axis instead.

### Not yet exposed via CLI (reachable via `--config FILE`)
- `use_async_reset` — unused (flops are always async-reset by discipline).
- Hierarchy field `library_prob` — future probabilistic mixed-sourcing dial for later Phase 4+ work.
- `max_nodes_per_module` — safety ceiling, not typically tuned.

## Knob serialization

Knobs are a `serde`-derived struct. Loading from JSON:

```bash
anvil --config knobs.json --seed 42
```

Writing the effective knobs back out (the merge of defaults and CLI
overrides) lets users save and replay configurations:

```bash
anvil --seed 42 --max-depth 8 --dump-config > my-knobs.json
anvil --config my-knobs.json --seed 42  # byte-identical to previous
```

The manifest file in the output directory records the effective knobs
used for that generation run. Reproducing any output requires only
the manifest entry, not the original CLI invocation.

## Knob effectiveness map

Per the measurement doctrine above, every knob has at least one
metric that captures its effect. The table below is the contract:
grep the metric, vary the knob across its range, confirm the
metric moves in the expected direction. If it doesn't, the knob
is either broken, masked by another knob, or redundant — all of
which are bugs worth investigating.

| Knob                          | Metric(s) that measure effectiveness                       |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `min_inputs` / `max_inputs`   | `num_inputs`                                               |
| `min_outputs` / `max_outputs` | `num_outputs`                                              |
| `min_width` / `max_width`     | port widths (in `manifest.json`), `constants_by_width`     |
| `max_depth`                   | `max_gate_depth`, `gate_depth_histogram` — monotone in the knob (typically 10–100× because block-assembly helpers expand each recursion level into multiple gate layers). |
| `flop_prob`                   | `num_flops` / `num_gates`                                  |

| `graph_first_pool_size`       | legacy knob; no effect on the current live path            |
| `priority_encoder_prob`       | `num_priority_encoder_blocks` — live counter, monotone in the knob |
| `case_mux_prob`               | `num_case_mux_blocks` — live counter, monotone in the knob |
| `casez_mux_prob`              | `num_casez_mux_blocks` — live counter, monotone in the knob |
| `for_fold_prob`               | `num_for_fold_blocks` — live counter, monotone in the knob |

| `min_gate_arity` / `max_gate_arity` | `max_operand_count_by_kind["add"]` / `["mul"]` / `["and"]` / `["or"]` / `["xor"]`; full histogram in `gate_operand_count_histogram` |
| `terminal_reuse_prob`         | `knob_roll_attempts["terminal_reuse_prob"]`, `knob_roll_fires["terminal_reuse_prob"]`; higher values raise exact-width leaf reuse |

| `identity_mode`               | `max_gate_ast_multiplicity`, `max_constant_ast_multiplicity`, `num_gates`, `semantic_gates_merged`, and `flops_merged`: `relaxed` disables the ladder entirely, so multiplicities rise, raw gate count rises, and both post-construction semantic merges drop to 0 |
| `factorization_level`         | `num_gates` (typically shrinks as the ladder rises toward `e-graph`); `nested_associative_operand_count` — residual flattening opportunity at / above `associative`, decreasing once that layer lands; `flops_merged` becomes eligible at `cse` and above; `semantic_gates_merged` becomes eligible at `e-graph` |

All knobs now have a concrete metric (or metric ratio) that
measures their effect. No *pending* entries remain. Future
additions will extend this table, not shrink its
pending-coverage.

### Per-knob roll-rate validation

For every probability-roll knob the metrics also expose
`knob_roll_attempts["<knob>_prob"]` and
`knob_roll_fires["<knob>_prob"]` — the raw attempt and fire
counts taken during construction. The empirical fire-rate
`fires / attempts` is a direct check on the knob:

- Default knobs at seed 42 produce ratios like
  `share_prob: 607/1999 ≈ 0.30` (default `0.3`),
  `coefficient_prob: 51/256 ≈ 0.20` (default `0.2`),
  `comb_mux_encoding_prob: 49/94 ≈ 0.52` (default `0.5`).
- A knob that consistently misses its configured rate
  indicates either a gating condition upstream (e.g.
  `flop_prob` rolls are gated on `flop_allowed`, so hitting
  `max_flops_per_module` cuts attempts) or a bug.
- The counters cover every instrumented `gen_bool(cfg.<prob>)` site in
  the generator — see `KnobId` in `src/ir/types.rs` for
  the full list (`flop_prob`, `comb_mux_prob`,
  `priority_encoder_prob`, `coefficient_prob`,
  `const_shift_amount_prob`, `const_comparand_prob`,
  `constant_prob`, `terminal_reuse_prob`,
  `comb_mux_encoding_prob`, `flop_mux_encoding_prob`,
  `share_prob`, `flop_qfeedback_prob`, `hierarchy_sibling_route_prob`,
  `hierarchy_child_input_cone_prob`, `hierarchy_parent_flop_prob`).

This is the measurability doctrine in its most direct form:
every probability dial's effect is a simple division away.

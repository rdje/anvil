# Code Base Analysis
Live analysis of the Rust workspace as it currently stands. Updated whenever a slice materially changes the workspace.

## Snapshot
- **Workspace:** single crate `anvil` (no Cargo workspace; flat layout).
- **Edition:** 2021.
- **Targets:** two binaries (`anvil` as Cargo's default run target, plus the auxiliary `tool_matrix` harness), one library (`anvil`), one example (`generate_one`), one integration test (`pipeline`).
- **External deps:** `rand`, `rand_chacha`, `clap`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `thiserror`, `anyhow`, `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber`. `insta` (dev) reserved for snapshot tests. `tracing` carries `release_max_level_info` so trace-level calls compile out in release.
- **MSRV:** pinned to Rust 1.95 via `Cargo.toml` `rust-version = "1.95"`.
- **Package description:** `Cargo.toml` describes ANVIL as a random by-construction generator of synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL; do not use SV/UVM-style constrained-random terminology for the crate purpose.

## Suitability assessment against the product goal

Short answer: **yes as a foundation, not yet as a completed generator**.

The current architecture is well matched to ANVIL's direction:

- typed IR construction instead of grammar/text emission;
- one combinational identity chokepoint in `ir/types.rs`;
- post-drain state and reachability finalisation in `ir/compact.rs`;
- validator-owned invariants in `ir/validate.rs`;
- explicit knob/control plumbing in `config.rs`; and
- a deliberately dumb SV emitter in `emit/sv.rs`.

That is the right base for a random by-construction, signoff-grade
synthesizable RTL generator. In this terminology, Verilator and Yosys
are validation tools used by this repository to check generated HDL
acceptance; the generated artifacts themselves target the broader class
of downstream HDL consumers such as parsers, elaborators, RTL compilers,
linters, simulators, and synthesis tools. The work still required falls
into four explicit gaps:

1. **Feature breadth / legal surface area / artifact-family breadth**
   The active generator is still grounded in the Phase 1/2/3
   leaf-module kernel, but it is no longer leaf-module-only. The
   previously explicit Phase 3 breadth gaps (`case`, `casez`, variable
   shifts, generic selectable `Slice` / `Concat`, bounded unrolled
   logic) are now landed, the dedicated Phase 3 structured-surface
   closure gate is landed, and Phase 4 hierarchy now has real depth-1
   and bounded recursive lanes with child sourcing, parent-side
   composition, registered routing, helper instances, and measurable
   design metrics. Parameterization, aggregates, memories, FSMs, and
   broader hierarchy-aware identity are still open. Beyond that, the
   newer user direction broadens the target beyond one output family:
   ANVIL should eventually generate more kinds of
   valid-by-construction synthesizable artifacts such as oracle-backed
   micro-design corpora and frontend/elaboration accept corpora. The
   current codebase supports this as an architectural direction, but it
   does not yet implement the needed source-level IR or artifact-family
   plumbing.
2. **`NodeId`-as-identity is only partially realized**
   `Module::intern_gate` gives a strong combinational canonicalization
   chokepoint and `merge_equivalent_flops` adds the first stateful
   sharing pass, but "same expression anywhere in the cone forest means
   same `NodeId`" is not yet fully true for stronger sequential
   equivalence or future hierarchical objects.
3. **Downstream-acceptance confidence still needs broader automation beyond current phase gates**
   The repo now has strong internal validation and strong local smoke
   evidence. That includes a real `tool_matrix --phase1-gate` frontier
   pushed to 365 warning-clean modules in the older no-ABC lane, a
   later historical both-mode frontier at 570 completed checkpoints /
   571 emitted files, and a completed current-code resumable both-mode
   tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r21` with a final
   `tool_matrix_report.json` at 1005 completed checkpoints / 1005
   emitted files, zero warning artifacts, full clean closure of all 15
   built-in scenarios, empty coverage gaps, and 1005/0 pass-fail in
   Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes. `tool_matrix` also now
   has a same-binary fast-resume path that can skip replaying
   already-proven modules when the checkpoint fingerprint and saved-SV
   hash still match, and the live `r21` bank has already been upgraded
   in place to that checkpoint format. The latest focused current-code
   `e-graph` proof (`seed=8 / interleaved / node-id / e-graph /
   count=54`) is also clean 54/54 in Verilator and both repo-owned
   Yosys modes. On top of that, the new
   `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase2-share-r1/tool_matrix_report.json`
   closes the representative Phase 2 sharing sweep locally: 216/0 in
   Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes, `coverage_gaps = []`,
   and a monotone normalized `share_sweep` summary across
   `share_prob ∈ {0.0, 0.3, 0.9}`. The Phase 3 structured-surface gate
   is also closed at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase3-structured-r4`,
   and the current Phase 4 hierarchy gate is closed at
   `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-hierarchy-r23` with 168/0 in
   Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes. So closure evidence now
   exists for the current Phase 1-4 surfaces; the remaining confidence
   gap is broader validation automation for future phases, richer knob
   sweeps, and the larger artifact-family space implied by the
   signoff-grade goal.
4. **The IR is optimized for structural legitimacy more than semantic
   richness today**
   That matches the project doctrine: whole-module intended behavior is
   usually arbitrary. The missing work is therefore not "add a
   bundled spec/oracle layer", but "add more legal, synthesizable,
   interaction-rich motifs, composition surfaces, and explicit
   expected-facts manifests where a particular artifact family needs
   them".

Taken literally against the user's `rtl_const_expr` / `rtl_frontend`
style request, the repo is **not ready yet**. It currently lacks:

- a source-level parameter / package / typedef / instantiation IR;
- frontend/elaboration fact modeling beyond the current structural
  generated-module hierarchy;
- manifest infrastructure for expected elaboration facts; and
- an artifact-family selector above the current leaf-module generator.

So the answer remains "yes as a foundation", but now with a clearer
explanation of what is missing for the broader artifact-family goal.

`ir` is a leaf. `gen` and `emit` both depend on `ir` but not on each other. This permits independent unit-testing of `emit` against hand-built IRs.

## Phase coverage map

| Phase | Status        | Code touched | Notes |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| 0 — Scaffolding              | done         | All files (initial) | Historical scaffold landed; current HEAD builds/tests/lints/formats clean again (see Build hygiene). |
| 1 — Single-module MVP        | done         | `gen/cone.rs`, `gen/module.rs`, `emit/sv.rs`, `gen/pool.rs`, `ir/types.rs`, `ir/compact.rs`, `metrics.rs` | Combinational + sequential cone recursion functional; flop worklist drained; `always_ff` emitted; single CLK + single RST_N (async). 22 structural rules enforced (Rules 1-22). Zero orphans restored at module finalisation via Rule-18 construction discipline plus `compact_node_ids`; final compaction now also drops dead flops whose `Q` is never observed, and the emitted input surface is trimmed to live ports/bits. Factorization ladder is live through a bounded `EGraph` fragment, with post-construction semantic gate merging for small-support cones, post-remap associative re-normalisation on the settled graph, a late mixed-associative-constant cleanup pass on that same settled graph, endpoint-preserving post-drain flop merging under `identity_mode = node-id`, strict Add/Mul remap-pruning under `operand_duplication_rate < 1.0`, a final exact-value cleanup pass (`fold_proven_gates`) for downstream-tool cleanliness that keeps the general exact prover tiny-only (width <= 8, support <= 10 bits, <= 3 canonical leaf endpoints) while still revisiting compare gates with the bounded unsigned-compare proof and shift gates with a bounds-only exact check, plus a tiny-domain rhs fallback for shift overshift proofs when narrow boolean-mask arithmetic keeps the rhs domain small even though the whole cone is large. Exit gate now closed locally via `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r21/tool_matrix_report.json` (1005 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, 1005/0 in Verilator and both repo-owned Yosys modes). |
| 2 — Sharing                  | done         | `gen/cone.rs`, `ir/types.rs`, `ir/compact.rs` | Per-operand `share_prob` hook wired; internal gates enter the pool as they are built. Construction-time CSE (Rule 21) + operand-uniqueness (Rule 8 extended) + commutative normalization (Rule 21b) + associative flattening + constant folding + peephole rewrites all enforced via `intern_gate`; the live bounded `EGraph` fragment now merges small-support combinational cones post-construction under `identity_mode = node-id`, duplicate flops merge post-drain when they are proven equal over the same canonical leaf endpoints by the same proof discipline, and late remaps are pruned when they would violate the strict Add/Mul duplicate policy. Final compaction cleans orphaned intermediates and dead state from these rewrites. Exit gate now closed locally via `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase2-share-r1/tool_matrix_report.json` (216 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, 216/0 in Verilator and both repo-owned Yosys modes). The representative sweep proves controllability with normalized `shared_node_fraction` rather than raw shared-node count, because stronger reuse collapses total node count. |
| 3 — Structured combinational | done         | `gen/cone.rs`, `ir/types.rs`, `emit/sv.rs`, `ir/validate.rs`, `metrics.rs`, `bin/tool_matrix.rs`, `ir/compact.rs` | Priority-encoder block (Rule 17), combinational mux block (Rule 15), procedural case-mux block (`always_comb case`), procedural casez-mux block (`always_comb casez` with non-overlapping wildcard patterns), structured bounded `for`-fold blocks (`always_comb` + `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)` over packed chunks), generic selectable `Slice` / variadic `Concat`, coefficient motif, both shift-amount paths (`const_shift_amount_prob` plus the ordinary variable-amount path), const-comparand motif, and reduction-category gate picking are all landed. The dedicated structured-surface closure gate now exists in `tool_matrix` as `--phase3-structured-gate`, and it is closed locally via `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase3-structured-r4/tool_matrix_report.json` (210 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, 210/0 in Verilator and both repo-owned Yosys modes). The runtime hotspot that surfaced while proving that gate was addressed at the real seam: large settled cones with tiny support now skip semantic merge proofs and fall back to structural proof instead of stalling in `semantic_cone_proof`. |
| 4 — Hierarchy                | in progress  | `gen/hierarchy.rs`, `ir/types.rs`, `ir/compact.rs`, `ir/validate.rs`, `emit/sv.rs`, `main.rs`, `metrics.rs`, `bin/tool_matrix.rs` | Current live slice now has two lanes: the legacy exact depth-1 wrapper planner and the newer bounded recursive planner. The wrapper lane still exercises exact, reuse, and under-instantiation profiles via `num_child_instances`; the recursive lane uses `min_hierarchy_depth..=max_hierarchy_depth` plus `min_child_instances_per_module..=max_child_instances_per_module`, now keeping every leaf depth inside the requested interval and mixing shallow/deep branches when the interval is open and the structure allows it. Repeated `child_instances_per_depth` overrides are now also live and let branching be steered by parent depth (`0` = top, `1` = its children, ...) on top of that global fallback range. Both hierarchy lanes now also expose an explicit child-sourcing axis, `hierarchy_child_source_mode = library | on-demand`: `library` keeps reusable child-definition pools, while the currently-landed `on-demand` slice synthesizes children against parent-planned exact data-interface profiles per planned instance slot. Both lanes build parent-side output cones over the full parent source pool, then repair finalized parent outputs so every output retains child `InstanceOutput` support and can also carry parent data-port support when such ports are live. Both lanes expose direct sibling-routed child-input binding via `hierarchy_sibling_route_prob`, registered sibling-routed child-input binding through one parent-local flop via `hierarchy_registered_sibling_route_prob`, registered parent-composed child-input binding through parent logic plus one parent-local flop via `hierarchy_registered_child_input_cone_prob`, parent-local child-input cones via `hierarchy_child_input_cone_prob` over parent data inputs / earlier sibling outputs / earlier parent-side route gates, optional local parent flops via `hierarchy_parent_flop_prob`, and parent-cone helper instances via `hierarchy_parent_cone_instance_prob` as internal sources for parent-composed child-input cones, direct sibling routes, direct registered sibling routes, registered child-input D cones, and parent-output cones. `max_parent_cone_instances_per_module` now controls the per-parent helper budget, and parent-output helper collection can spend multiple helper instances directly instead of sharing one optional helper source across the whole parent-output set. The registered parent-composed route now builds from the full parent source pool too, so it can mix parent data ports with sibling outputs when both supports are live, later routes can chain through earlier parent-local Qs, and helper outputs can be folded into the D cone when helper placement is enabled. Hierarchy manifests/reports now carry exact per-design `DesignMetrics`, so hierarchy quality is measurable without SV inspection (coverage, reuse, single-use-vs-multiuse child structure, exact profiled interface realization, child-input provenance including parent-flop, registered-instance-output, registered-parent-composed, registered-mixed-support, registered-multistage parent-composed, and registered parent-cone helper bindings, sibling-routing fractions, registered sibling-routing fractions, registered parent-composed fractions, registered mixed-support fractions, registered multistage parent-composed fractions, registered helper-route fractions, parent-composed child-input fractions, parent-flop child-input fractions, parent-cone helper-instance counts/fractions and per-parent maximum, parent-output helper-instance support counts/fractions, local parent-state counts, top-interface shape, direct-vs-composed outputs, parent-port-composed output counts/fractions, child-output dependency fractions/support, realized depth, depth histograms, leaf-depth histograms, branching histograms, per-depth branching summaries, control fanout, weighted child load). The emitted-boundary doctrine is explicit too: pure comb-only modules omit `clk` / `rst_n`, while hierarchy parents keep them visible iff they carry local state or sequential descendants. Module names are reserved from one generator-global sequence, so repeated hierarchy designs in one output directory cannot reuse the same definition filename. The fully banked repo-owned Phase 4 matrix is now `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-hierarchy-r23/tool_matrix_report.json` (168 designs, `coverage_gaps = []`, 168/0 in Verilator and both repo-owned Yosys modes), and it covers wrapper exact/reuse/under-instantiation, recursive depth `2`, mixed recursive depth range `2:3`, explicit child-sourcing modes `library` and `on-demand`, child-instance profiles `2`, `4`, `2:3`, `1:3`, the per-depth override profile `0=4:4,1=2:2`, real mixed shallow/deep recursive realization, real on-demand child sourcing, exact profiled child-interface synthesis, real sibling-routed child inputs, real registered sibling-routed child inputs, real registered parent-composed child-input bindings, real registered mixed-support child-input bindings, real multi-stage registered parent-composed child-input bindings, real parent-composed child-input bindings, real parent-cone helper-instance child-input bindings, parent-output helper-instance composition, budgeted multi-helper allocation, registered parent-composed helper-sourced child-input D cones, real local parent flops, real parent-side composition, and real mixed parent-port / child-output parent outputs. Focused regressions now cover direct sibling helper routing and direct registered sibling helper routing; both postdate `r23`. The clean `r22` run is retained as root-cause evidence for the stale 126-design total-budget mismatch, while `r21` remains historical pre-parent-output-helper evidence. Earlier current-code coverage-only probes first kept the Phase 4 coverage policy honest for mixed parent-output composition, registered mixed-support routing, multi-stage registered routing, and parent-cone helper routing; `r23` now carries those facts plus helper-output, budgeted-helper, and registered-helper route facts through the full downstream-clean gate. The focused clean smokes at `/tmp/anvil-hier-parent-compose-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-range-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-depth-profile-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-mixed-depth-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-profiled-ondemand-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-sibling-routing-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-child-input-cone-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-parent-state-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-registered-sibling-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-registered-child-input-cone-smoke-r2/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-parent-output-mix-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, `/tmp/anvil-hier-registered-mixed-child-input-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, and `/tmp/anvil-hier-registered-multistage-child-input-smoke-r1/manifest.json`, and `/tmp/anvil-parent-cone-instance-smoke-r1/manifest.json` remain useful targeted evidence. Broader helper-instance placement beyond the current parent-composed child-input, direct sibling, direct registered sibling, registered child-input, and budgeted parent-output helper slices, broader registered hierarchy routing/composition patterns, and future hierarchy-aware identity remain open. |

## Invariants currently enforced

In code (constructors / generator):
- `Module::intern_gate` / `intern_constant` enforce the currently-implemented combinational factorization ladder (Rule 21 / 21b / 21c): associative flattening, commutative sort on `And`/`Or`/`Xor`/`Add`/`Mul`, constant folding, peephole rewrites, then AST-cap CSE keyed by `(op, operands, width)` / `(width, value)`. `identity_mode = Relaxed` forces the effective level to `None`; `identity_mode = NodeId` uses `FactorizationLevel::effective()`, which now keeps the bounded `EGraph` fragment live at the top rung. Doctrinally, `node-id` still means full factorization (`NodeId` = expression identity); the ladder is the current build's enforcement/proof-depth dial inside that doctrine, not a competing definition of `node-id`.
- `Config::validate()` rejects out-of-range knobs.
- `Generator::new()` seeds RNG deterministically.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` produces port counts within knob ranges.
- `gen::cone::build_cone_with_retry` retries up to 4× on empty-dep-set cone roots; snapshots `m.nodes`, `m.flops`, pool, worklist, `gate_instances`, `const_instances` before each attempt and restores on empty-dep retry.
- `gen::cone::build_cone` snapshots the same state before operand construction. On anti-collapse rejection, restores the snapshot and returns `pick_terminal` as fallback. No orphan leaks from rejected recursive gates.
- `gen::cone::process_signal_frame` (interleaved) uses an existing operand as anti-collapse fallback (not `pick_terminal`) because per-gate snapshot is infeasible once sibling frames have committed.
- `gen::module::summarize_flop_mux_metadata` clears construction-only mux operand references once `flop.d` exists, so metadata-only select/data cones do not survive liveness/compaction.
- `ir::compact::merge_equivalent_gates` is the first live post-construction combinational `EGraph` fragment. It runs only under `identity_mode = NodeId` with effective level `>= EGraph`, and merges gates by endpoint-preserving proof forms: same width, same canonical primary-input / flop-Q leaf endpoints, and same currently-proven functionality. For small-support cones the proof may be semantic (bounded truth table); otherwise it falls back to the normalized structural proof. Different endpoint variables do not merge.
- `ir::compact::merge_equivalent_flops` is the first stateful extension of the NodeId-as-identity contract. It runs after D-cones exist, only under `identity_mode = NodeId` with effective level `>= Cse`, and merges flops by an endpoint-preserving proof subset: same `width`, `reset_kind`, `reset_val`, and the same D-cone proof over canonical primary-input / flop-Q endpoints. That proof is structural over the normalized IR by default, with a bounded semantic truth-table signature for small-support cones. The pass rewires duplicate Q consumers, remaps virtual flop deps, renumbers surviving flops, and rebuilds dedup tables. Different endpoint variables do not merge, even if the cone skeleton looks similar. It is still far short of coinductive sequential equivalence.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` now re-runs associative normalisation on the settled graph via `ir::compact::flatten_posthoc_associative_gates` after remap-producing passes (`fold_proven_gates`, `merge_equivalent_gates`). This keeps `nested_associative_operand_count` at zero for legal flattening opportunities even when a later remap changes which already-built node an operand points at.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` now repairs any settled-graph output drive root whose deps have collapsed to empty after the late proof-cleanup passes. The repair swaps in a dep-bearing exact-width source (or width-adapter) before final compaction so finalized outputs stay functions of primary inputs and/or flop-Q leaves rather than trivial constants.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` runs `count_orphan_gates(m)` after the merge / before compaction as a Rule 18 safety-net audit, then `compact_node_ids`, then a second orphan audit; `m.semantic_gates_merged`, `m.flops_merged`, and `m.nodes_compacted` record the numbers of removed duplicates / unreachable nodes.
- `gen::module::shrink_primary_inputs_to_live_width` reduces each surviving primary input to the highest bit any live consumer touches; `prune_unused_input_ports` removes data-input ports with no surviving `PrimaryInput` node.
- `gen::cone::pick_terminal` prefers matching-width pool entries with non-empty deps; on no width-match, builds a width-adapter (`make_width_adapter`) from the widest dep-bearing pool entry; only emits a constant when the entire pool has empty deps.
- `gen::cone::build_cone` consults `cfg.share_prob` per operand: with that probability it calls `try_share` to return an existing matching-width pool entry (with deps, honoring `exclude`); otherwise it recurses. Fresh `Gate` nodes enter the pool on creation, so later operand decisions in the same call chain can share them.
- `gen::cone::make_width_adapter` produces a Slice (when source > target) or an exact-width Concat (when source < target), using a leading low Slice only for the remainder chunk in non-multiple expansions. Deps propagate from the source.
- `gen::cone::violates_anti_collapse` rejects duplicate operands in `And`/`Or`/`Xor` whenever the effective factorization level is `>= OperandUnique`, rejects duplicate operands in `Add`/`Mul` at the same levels when `operand_duplication_rate < 1.0`, rejects `x - x`, `x == x`, `x != x` at 2-arity, and rejects `mux(s, a, a)` when `mux_arm_duplication_rate < 1.0`. `or_reduce_terms` dedups input terms before chaining Ors; `make_none_selected` routes through it. See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 8.
- `gen::cone::pick_gate` only offers comparison ops when the parent target width is 1.
- `gen::cone::build_flop_leaf` allocates `Flop` (with random `FlopKind`) and `FlopQ` together; `Flop.q` always points at the new `FlopQ` node; `Flop.d` and `Flop.mux` are filled later by `drain_flop_worklist`.
- All flops use `ResetKind::Async` unconditionally (single-CLK / single-RST_N synchronous discipline).
- `pick_mux_arm_count` returns M from {0, 2, 3, ..., max_mux_arms}. M = 1 is excluded by design.
- `drain_flop_worklist` constructs each flop's D as one of:
  - (a) a direct recursive cone when M=0;
  - (b) one-hot mux `OR_i({N{sel_i}} & data_i)` (+ `{N{none_selected}} & Q` for `QFeedback`) for the OneHot style;
  - (c) encoded-select chained-ternary mux over `Eq(sel, k)` with a fall-through of 0 (ZeroDefault) or Q (QFeedback) for the Encoded style. QFeedback+Encoded replaces `data_0` with Q.
  The style is picked per-flop via `cfg.flop_mux_encoding_prob`. Sub-cones pass `exclude = None`: this flop's Q is a freely-reachable leaf inside its own D-cone sub-cones. See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 2 for the authoritative statement; Rule 3 covers the explicit QFeedback mux term.
- `pick_terminal_dep_bearing(g, m, pool, width, exclude)` is a strict variant of `pick_terminal`: only admits (1) a random dep-bearing matching-width pool entry or (2) a width-adapter from the widest dep-bearing pool entry. Today it is used by the legacy pool-only helpers (`build_graph_first`, comb-mux / priority-encoder / const-shift pool paths); the active recursive/interleaved output-cone paths build those signals via `build_cone` instead. Panics if the pool has no dep-bearing entry (invariant). See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 20.
- `pick_coefficient(g, width)` clamps the draw range to `[max(min_coefficient,1), min(max_coefficient, 2^W-1)]` so the emitted `width`-bit `Constant` can never overflow its declared width. Width=1 forces c=1; larger widths see the unclamped range up to `2^W-1`. See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 19.
- Associative operators (`And`, `Or`, `Xor`, `Add`, `Mul`) are N-arity with N drawn from `[cfg.min_gate_arity, cfg.max_gate_arity]` each emission. `Sub` stays strictly 2-arity (not associative). Non-operators retain their natural operand counts. See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 14 and the "Operators vs blocks" preamble.
- The full catalog of enforced invariants lives in `book/src/structural-rules.md`. This file's invariants lists above are a summary with pointers to the catalog.
- `pick_terminal` filters out the excluded `NodeId` from every candidate set (matching-width, dep-bearing, fallback adapter source).
- `build_cone`, `process_signal_frame`, `grow_pool_one_unit`, `pick_terminal`, and `drain_flop_worklist` route every leaf/cone probability choice through `roll_knob`, populating `m.knob_rolls` for measurability of `flop_prob`, `comb_mux_prob`, `priority_encoder_prob`, `coefficient_prob`, `const_shift_amount_prob`, `const_comparand_prob`, `constant_prob`, `terminal_reuse_prob`, `comb_mux_encoding_prob`, `flop_mux_encoding_prob`, `share_prob`, and `flop_qfeedback_prob`. Hierarchy binding helpers separately record the hierarchy probability knobs into the same `m.knob_rolls` sink: `hierarchy_sibling_route_prob`, `hierarchy_registered_sibling_route_prob`, `hierarchy_registered_child_input_cone_prob`, `hierarchy_child_input_cone_prob`, `hierarchy_parent_cone_instance_prob`, and `hierarchy_parent_flop_prob`.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` reserves port id 0 for `clk` and 1 for `rst_n`. Neither is added to the signal pool, so cones cannot terminate at them.
- `Config::validate()` still enforces the legacy exact wrapper lane
  (`hierarchy_depth ∈ {0,1}`, `num_leaf_modules >= 1` when exact
  hierarchy is enabled, `num_child_instances > 0` rejected in leaf-only
  mode), but current HEAD also validates the bounded recursive lane:
  exact legacy wrapper knobs and recursive range knobs are mutually
  exclusive, bounded ranges must satisfy `1 <= min <= max`, repeated
  `child_instances_per_depth` overrides must also satisfy
  `1 <= min <= max`, they may only target realized internal parent
  depths inside `[0, max_hierarchy_depth - 1]`, and `num_leaf_modules`
  is intentionally restricted to the legacy exact wrapper lane.

In `ir::validate::validate`:
- Operand `NodeId`s in range.
- Every drive root `NodeId` exists, and each output port has exactly
  one drive.
- Every flop table slot keeps the dense canonical relation
  `m.flops[idx].id == idx`.
- Every flop has a `d` set.
- `Flop.d`, `Flop.q`, and every `NodeId` held inside `FlopMux`
  point at live nodes.
- `Flop.q` points at `Node::FlopQ { flop: self.id, width:
  self.width }`.
- Every `Node::FlopQ` references a real flop, matches the owning
  flop's width, and is that flop's canonical `q` node.
- Output-cone root has non-empty dep-set.
- Per-gate arity: each `GateOp` variant has a fixed or variadic-with-min operand count.
- Per-gate operand widths: `And/Or/Xor/Add/Sub/Mul` / `Not` require operand width == output width; `Mux` requires sel 1-bit + two data operands at output width; `Eq/Neq/Lt/Gt/Le/Ge` require equal-width operands + 1-bit output; `RedAnd/RedOr/RedXor` require 1-bit output; `Shl/Shr` require value operand at output width (shift amount unconstrained); `Slice{hi,lo}` requires `hi >= lo`, `out_w == hi-lo+1`, source width > `hi`; `Concat` requires sum of operand widths == output width.

In `ir::validate::validate_design`:
- Every module name in `Design.modules` is unique.
- The generator now reserves module names through one global sequence,
  so hierarchy output also avoids cross-design filename collisions when
  `--count N --out DIR` emits multiple designs into the same directory.
- `Design.top` names a real module.
- Every instance references a real child module.
- Every child emitted input port is bound exactly once, at the right
  width.
- Every referenced child output port maps to a real
  `Node::InstanceOutput` of matching width in the parent; unused child
  outputs may stay unconnected.
- The module-instance graph is acyclic.

- Current executed counts (`cargo test`, 2026-04-27): **220 unit-target tests + 53 integration tests = 273 passing tests**. Doc-tests: 0.
- No external Verilator / Yosys smoke tests are wired into `cargo test`
  yet. A repo-owned `tool_matrix` harness now exists for broader
  sweeps; the smoke matrix is green, the full current-code Phase 1
  gate is now closed via
  `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r21/tool_matrix_report.json`
  (1005 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, and 1005/0 pass-fail in
  Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes), and the representative
  Phase 2 sharing gate is now closed via
  `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase2-share-r1/tool_matrix_report.json`
  (216 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, and 216/0 pass-fail in Verilator
  plus both repo-owned Yosys modes), and the new dedicated Phase 3
  structured gate is now closed via
  `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase3-structured-r4/tool_matrix_report.json`
  (210 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, and 210/0 pass-fail in Verilator
  plus both repo-owned Yosys modes). A first real hierarchy smoke now
  exists too at `/tmp/anvil-hierarchy-smoke-r1`, clean in Verilator,
  Yosys `synth -noabc`, and the repo-owned ABC path for a depth-1
  wrapper design. A focused current-code parent-composition smoke now
  exists too at `/tmp/anvil-hier-parent-compose-smoke-r1`, clean in the
  same three lanes while its manifest proves `top_parent_composed_outputs > 0`
  and `top_instance_output_dependency_fraction = 1.0`. The dedicated
  Phase 4 hierarchy gate is now closed too at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-hierarchy-r23/tool_matrix_report.json`
  (168 designs, `coverage_gaps = []`, and 168/0 pass-fail in Verilator
  plus both repo-owned Yosys modes). That refreshed report now covers
  wrapper exact / reuse / under-instantiation plus recursive depth `2`,
  mixed recursive depth range `2:3`, explicit child-sourcing modes
  `library` and `on-demand`, child-instance profiles `2`, `4`, `2:3`,
  and `1:3`, the per-depth override profile `0=4:4,1=2:2`, real mixed
  shallow/deep recursive realization, real on-demand child sourcing,
  exact profiled child-interface synthesis, real parent-side composition above instance outputs, real sibling-routed hierarchy child inputs, real registered sibling-routed child inputs, real registered parent-composed child-input bindings, registered mixed-support child-input bindings, multi-stage registered parent-composed child-input bindings, real parent-composed child-input bindings, parent-cone helper-instance child-input bindings, parent-output helper-instance composition, budgeted multi-helper allocation, registered parent-composed helper-sourced child-input D cones, real mixed parent-port / child-output parent outputs, and real local parent flops. The current `tool_matrix` policy now also covers the newer direct sibling helper route and direct registered sibling helper route through the coverage-only `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-direct-helper-r24/tool_matrix_report.json` run (`48` scenarios, `192` designs, `coverage_gaps = []`, tools skipped); the latest full downstream-clean `r23` bank predates both routes. The stale-total-budget `r22` run is clean but insufficient root-cause evidence at 126 designs; `r23` is the current full bank. The `r23` full downstream-clean report records
  `saw_hierarchy_parent_port_composed_outputs = true`,
  `saw_hierarchy_registered_mixed_support_routing = true`,
  `saw_hierarchy_registered_multistage_routing = true`,
  `saw_hierarchy_parent_cone_instance_routing = true`,
  `saw_hierarchy_parent_cone_instance_outputs = true`,
  `saw_multiple_parent_cone_instances_per_parent = true`, and
  `saw_hierarchy_registered_parent_cone_instance_routing = true`, so the earlier
  coverage-only probes at
  `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-parent-port-coverage-r1/tool_matrix_report.json`,
  `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-registered-mixed-r1/tool_matrix_report.json`,
  and `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-registered-multistage-r1/tool_matrix_report.json`
  are now historical policy breadcrumbs rather than the strongest
  current evidence.
  The focused smokes at
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-reuse-smoke-r1`,
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-under-smoke-r2`,
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-range-smoke-r1`, and
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-depth-profile-smoke-r1`, and
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-mixed-depth-smoke-r1`, and
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-profiled-ondemand-smoke-r1`, and
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-sibling-routing-smoke-r1`,
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-child-input-cone-smoke-r1`,
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-parent-state-smoke-r1`,
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-registered-sibling-smoke-r1`,
  `/tmp/anvil-hier-registered-child-input-cone-smoke-r2`,
  `/tmp/anvil-parent-cone-instance-smoke-r1`, and
  `cargo test hierarchy_sibling_routes_can_use_helper_instances`, and
  `cargo test hierarchy_registered_sibling_routes_can_use_helper_instances` remain useful targeted
  proofs, while the old `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-hierarchy-r7`
  report is now the historical wrapper-baseline artifact, `r9` is the
  pre-mixed recursive bank, `r10` is the pre-on-demand mixed-depth
  bank, `r11` is the first explicit child-sourcing bank, `r15` is the
  pre-parent-state bank, `r16` is the pre-registered-sibling-route
  bank, `r17` is the pre-registered-parent-composed-route bank, `r18`
  is the first registered-parent-composed bank, `r20` is the
  pre-parent-cone helper-instance bank, and the aborted `r8`
  rerun is historical
  runtime evidence that the Phase 4 gate should use a
  hierarchy-focused sequential leaf profile instead of silently
  borrowing the fattest Phase 1 leaf-stress shape.

## Known weaknesses (visible in code today)

- The broader signoff-grade cleanliness matrix described in
  `ROADMAP.md` now has a repo-owned implementation in
  `src/bin/tool_matrix.rs`, and the smoke matrix is currently green:
  15/15 clean in Verilator and 15/15 clean in Yosys. The harness now
  treats warnings as failures, so "green" here means no errors and no
  warnings, not merely zero non-zero exits. The repo-owned gate surface
  now also includes the dedicated `--phase2-share-gate`, whose
  normalized `share_sweep` summary proves that stronger `share_prob`
  increases the *fraction* of shared nodes even though the raw shared
  node count falls as the graph collapses.
- `NodeId`-as-identity is still conservative for state and does not yet
  extend to future hierarchical objects. Exact-signature duplicate
  flops merge; stronger sequential/hierarchical equivalence remains open
  work.
- Phase 4 is no longer only the first depth-1 slice. The legacy exact
  wrapper lane is still real, and the repo-owned Phase 4 gate now also
  banks the current representative bounded-recursive hierarchy surface,
  including the mixed-depth recursive axis and explicit `library` vs
  `on-demand` child sourcing. Current HEAD now also has a real
  combinational sibling-routing surface, parent-composed child-input
  cone surface, parent-cone helper-instance child-input route,
  parent-cone helper-instance parent-output route,
  budgeted parent-cone helper allocation,
  registered helper-sourced child-input D cones,
  direct sibling helper routing,
  direct registered sibling helper routing,
  optional local parent flops, a first one-flop
  registered sibling-route surface, a registered parent-composed
  child-input route surface, and mixed parent-port / child-output
  parent outputs. Current HEAD also lets the registered
  parent-composed child-input route mix parent data ports with sibling
  outputs and chain through earlier parent-local Qs. These surfaces are
  proved numerically in focused smokes and the banked `r23` hierarchy
  report, which now requires
  `saw_hierarchy_parent_port_composed_outputs`,
  `saw_hierarchy_registered_mixed_support_routing`, and
  `saw_hierarchy_registered_multistage_routing`, and
  `saw_hierarchy_parent_cone_instance_routing`,
  `saw_hierarchy_parent_cone_instance_outputs`,
  `saw_multiple_parent_cone_instances_per_parent`,
  `saw_hierarchy_registered_parent_cone_instance_routing`,
  `saw_hierarchy_direct_sibling_parent_cone_instance_routing`, and
  `saw_hierarchy_direct_registered_sibling_parent_cone_instance_routing`
  in the current coverage-only `r24` policy. The next honest work
  is broader helper-instance placement beyond the current
  parent-composed child-input, direct sibling, direct registered sibling,
  registered child-input, and budgeted parent-output helper slices,
  broader registered
  hierarchy routing/composition where it is structurally warranted, and
  future hierarchy-aware identity.
- `emit::sv::render_gate` for `Concat` joins operand names with commas (correct SV); the IR does not currently distinguish per-operand widths in storage because every current producer of `Concat` either replicates a single source or concatenates uniform-width bits. When variadic `Concat` with mixed widths becomes a real motif, the IR shape is still adequate (widths are a property of each operand node, not of the `Concat` itself), but a generator-side helper will need to compose such shapes carefully.

## Build hygiene
- `cargo check --all-targets` — clean.
- `cargo test` — clean (273 passing tests: 189 lib + 5 main + 26 tool_matrix + 53 integration).
- `cargo build` — clean.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean.
- `cargo fmt --all --check` — clean.
- `mdbook build book` — clean.
- Generator-output smoke: Verilator lint on seed 42 is clean with no warning-specific suppressions beyond the usual filename noise; the previous `UNSIGNED` / `CMPCONST` tautology residue is now folded away in the IR; a default + graph-first-alias seed sweep (0..4) is clean for `UNUSEDSIGNAL`; the live `seed=0 / interleaved / relaxed / none` repro (`mod_0_0006.sv`) is now clean in both Verilator and `yosys ... synth -noabc`; the built-in `tool_matrix` smoke run is 15/15 clean in Verilator and 15/15 clean in Yosys under `--yosys-mode without-abc`; a small `--yosys-mode both` probe is now clean in both Yosys sub-modes too (`without-abc = 15/15 pass`, `with-abc = 15/15 pass`) after moving the ABC-enabled harness path to `synth -noabc; abc -fast; opt -fast; stat; check`; a same-binary fast-resume smoke on `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-resume-fast-smoke-r1` now completes cleanly both on the initial run and on the immediate `--resume` rerun, and saved checkpoints now include `runtime_fingerprint`, `sv_hash`, and `generator_checkpoint`; a real baseline `tool_matrix --phase1-gate` rerun has now been pushed to **365 generated modules** with **0 Verilator warning logs** and **0 Yosys warning lines** across the saved stdout logs (67 clean each in `int_relaxed_none_default`, `int_nodeid_none_default`, `int_nodeid_cse_default`, `int_nodeid_operand-unique_default`, and `int_nodeid_commutative_default`, plus 30 clean in `int_nodeid_associative_default` before checkpoint); the historical current-code real both-mode `tool_matrix --phase1-gate --yosys-mode both` tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r20` still stands at **570 completed module checkpoints / 571 emitted `.sv` files** with the same zero-warning bar (67 clean each in `int_relaxed_none_default`, `int_nodeid_none_default`, `int_nodeid_cse_default`, `int_nodeid_operand-unique_default`, `int_nodeid_commutative_default`, `int_nodeid_associative_default`, `int_nodeid_constant-fold_default`, and `int_nodeid_peephole_default`, plus 34 clean in `int_nodeid_e-graph_default` before intentional checkpoint); the completed current-code real both-mode `tool_matrix --phase1-gate --yosys-mode both --resume` tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r21` now has a final `tool_matrix_report.json` with **1005** completed module checkpoints / **1005** emitted `.sv` files, `coverage_gaps = []`, and the same zero-warning bar (`Verilator 1005/0`, `Yosys without-abc 1005/0`, `Yosys with-abc 1005/0`), with all **1005** saved checkpoints on `r21` already carrying the fast-resume metadata; the completed Phase 2 share-sweep tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase2-share-r1` now has a final `tool_matrix_report.json` with **216** completed module checkpoints / **216** emitted `.sv` files, `coverage_gaps = []`, and the same zero-warning bar (`Verilator 216/0`, `Yosys without-abc 216/0`, `Yosys with-abc 216/0`), while the normalized `share_sweep` summary proves the representative sharing knob sweep directly (`shared_node_fraction = 0.4122`, `0.4232`, `0.4386` at `share_prob = 0.0`, `0.3`, `0.9` respectively, alongside the expected node-count collapse); the completed Phase 3 structured-surface tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase3-structured-r4` now has a final `tool_matrix_report.json` with **210** completed module checkpoints / **210** emitted `.sv` files, `coverage_gaps = []`, and the same zero-warning bar (`Verilator 210/0`, `Yosys without-abc 210/0`, `Yosys with-abc 210/0`); the dedicated Phase 4 wrapper hierarchy gate is now also closed at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-hierarchy-r7/tool_matrix_report.json` with **48** completed designs / **48** emitted design checkpoints, `artifact_kind = "design"`, `coverage_gaps = []`, and the same zero-warning bar (`Verilator 48/0`, `Yosys without-abc 48/0`, `Yosys with-abc 48/0`); the older depth-1 hierarchy smoke at `/tmp/anvil-hierarchy-smoke-r1` remains clean in Verilator, Yosys `synth -noabc`, and the repo-owned ABC path for a four-module emitted design (three leaves plus one top wrapper); and the newer hierarchy-metrics smoke at `/tmp/anvil-hier-metrics-smoke-r1` is also clean in the same three lanes while proving trustworthy design-level composition metrics plus the exact control-port propagation rule (`top_clock_inputs = 1`, `top_reset_inputs = 1`, `clock_fanout_instances = 5`, `reset_fanout_instances = 5`). A real partial both-mode smoke run interrupted at 14/15 scenarios was then completed successfully on the same output tree under `--resume`, ending at 15/15 clean in Verilator and both Yosys sub-modes; the legacy `r11` both-mode frontier has now been upgraded in place through **143** module checkpoints with the same zero-warning bar (67 relaxed, 67 nodeid-none, and 9 cse); after the exact-proof budget fix, a focused current-code repro (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 2 --count 10 --out /tmp/anvil-cse-seed2-repro-r1 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level cse`) now emits all 10 modules cleanly, with `fails=0` / `warns=0` under Verilator, Yosys `synth -noabc`, and the repo-owned ABC-enabled Yosys path; the stricter cleanup-proof eligibility cap is now also proven on the old `nodeid-cse` stall boundary (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 2 --count 2 --out /tmp/anvil-cse-seed2-repro-r2 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level cse`), which emits both modules cleanly under Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes; the next support-cap refinement is also now proven on the old `operand-unique` stall boundary (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 3 --count 21 --out /tmp/anvil-operand-unique-seed3-repro-r1 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level operand-unique`), which emits all 21 modules cleanly through `mod_3_0020.sv`, and all 21 are warning-clean in Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes; the next warning fix is now also proven on the first fresh-current-code `nodeid-none` boundary (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 1 --count 23 --out /tmp/anvil-nodeid-none-seed1-repro-r1 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level none`), which emits through `mod_1_0022.sv`, and all 23 modules are warning-clean in Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes; the old associative warning boundary is now also proven clean on focused current-code repros (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 5 --count 12 --out /tmp/anvil-associative-seed5-repro-r1 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level associative` and `cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 5 --count 16 --out /tmp/anvil-associative-seed5-repro-r8 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level associative`), where the checked modules are warning-clean in Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes; and the older `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r16` and `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r12` trees remain historical evidence only across older code.
- `src/gen/cone.rs` now owns an always-on generator-side comparison
  proof in addition to the factorization ladder. The proof combines a
  conservative unsigned-bounds engine with an exact finite-set engine
  for comparison operands up to 8 bits wide, and it is used in every
  comparison-emission path (recursive, interleaved, pool-only, and
  constant-comparand helpers). The exact-proof helpers now also
  short-circuit on absorbing / saturating exact prefixes and duplicate
  XOR parity, so small-width exact results are not lost just because an
  irrelevant tail depends on a wider cone. That exact finite-set engine
  is now explicitly budgeted, memoizes both exact and unknown results,
  and is further capped to small-support cones (current cap: 3
  canonical leaf endpoints), so the proof remains useful on narrow
  cones without turning into a runtime trap on correlation-heavy shared
  cartesian searches. The cheap exact/bounds layer also now carries the
  reflexive arithmetic identity `x - x = 0`, because that fact must
  stay available even when the heavier finite-set prover declines a
  cone. This is an enforced output-cleanliness invariant, not a user
  knob.

# Code Base Analysis
Live analysis of the Rust workspace as it currently stands. Updated whenever a slice materially changes the workspace.

## Snapshot
- **Workspace:** single crate `anvil` (no Cargo workspace; flat layout).
- **Edition:** 2021.
- **Targets:** two binaries (`anvil` as Cargo's default run target, plus the auxiliary `tool_matrix` harness), one library (`anvil`), one example (`generate_one`), one integration test (`pipeline`).
- **External deps:** `rand`, `rand_chacha`, `clap`, `serde`, `serde_json`, `thiserror`, `anyhow`, `tracing`, `tracing-subscriber`. `insta` (dev) reserved for snapshot tests. `tracing` carries `release_max_level_info` so trace-level calls compile out in release.
- **MSRV:** pinned to Rust 1.95 via `Cargo.toml` `rust-version = "1.95"`.
- **Package description:** `Cargo.toml` describes ANVIL as a random by-construction generator of synthesizable SystemVerilog RTL; do not use SV/UVM-style constrained-random terminology for the crate purpose.

## Suitability assessment against the product goal

Short answer: **yes as a foundation, not yet as a completed generator**.

The current architecture is well matched to ANVIL's direction:

- typed IR construction instead of grammar/text emission;
- one combinational identity chokepoint in `ir/types.rs`;
- post-drain state and reachability finalisation in `ir/compact.rs`;
- validator-owned invariants in `ir/validate.rs`;
- explicit knob/control plumbing in `config.rs`; and
- a deliberately dumb SV emitter in `emit/sv.rs`.

That is the right base for a random by-construction, signoff-grade
synthesizable RTL generator. In this terminology, Verilator and Yosys
are validation tools used by this repository to check generated HDL
acceptance; the generated artifacts themselves target the broader class
of downstream HDL consumers such as parsers, elaborators, RTL compilers,
linters, simulators, and synthesis tools. The work still required falls
into four explicit gaps:

1. **Feature breadth / legal surface area / artifact-family breadth**
   The active generator is still grounded in the Phase 1/2/3
   leaf-module kernel, but it is no longer leaf-module-only. The
   previously explicit Phase 3 breadth gaps (`case`, `casez`, variable
   shifts, generic selectable `Slice` / `Concat`, bounded unrolled
   logic) are now landed, the dedicated Phase 3 structured-surface
   closure gate is landed, and Phase 4 hierarchy now has real depth-1
   and bounded recursive lanes with child sourcing, parent-side
   composition, registered routing, helper instances, and measurable
   design metrics. Parameterization, aggregates, memories, FSMs, and
   broader hierarchy-aware identity are still open. Beyond that, the
   newer user direction broadens the target beyond one output family:
   ANVIL should eventually generate more kinds of
   valid-by-construction synthesizable artifacts such as oracle-backed
   micro-design corpora and frontend/elaboration accept corpora. The
   current codebase supports this as an architectural direction, but it
   does not yet implement the needed source-level IR or artifact-family
   plumbing.
2. **`NodeId`-as-identity is only partially realized**
   `Module::intern_gate` gives a strong combinational canonicalization
   chokepoint and `merge_equivalent_flops` adds the first stateful
   sharing pass, but "same expression anywhere in the cone forest means
   same `NodeId`" is not yet fully true for stronger sequential
   equivalence or future hierarchical objects.
3. **Downstream-acceptance confidence still needs broader automation beyond current phase gates**
   The repo now has strong internal validation and strong local smoke
   evidence. That includes a real `tool_matrix --phase1-gate` frontier
   pushed to 365 warning-clean modules in the older no-ABC lane, a
   later historical both-mode frontier at 570 completed checkpoints /
   571 emitted files, and a completed current-code resumable both-mode
   tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r21` with a final
   `tool_matrix_report.json` at 1005 completed checkpoints / 1005
   emitted files, zero warning artifacts, full clean closure of all 15
   built-in scenarios, empty coverage gaps, and 1005/0 pass-fail in
   Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes. `tool_matrix` also now
   has a same-binary fast-resume path that can skip replaying
   already-proven modules when the checkpoint fingerprint and saved-SV
   hash still match, and the live `r21` bank has already been upgraded
   in place to that checkpoint format. The latest focused current-code
   `e-graph` proof (`seed=8 / interleaved / node-id / e-graph /
   count=54`) is also clean 54/54 in Verilator and both repo-owned
   Yosys modes. On top of that, the new
   `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase2-share-r1/tool_matrix_report.json`
   closes the representative Phase 2 sharing sweep locally: 216/0 in
   Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes, `coverage_gaps = []`,
   and a monotone normalized `share_sweep` summary across
   `share_prob ∈ {0.0, 0.3, 0.9}`. The Phase 3 structured-surface gate
   is also closed at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase3-structured-r4`,
   and the latest full downstream-clean Phase 4 hierarchy gate is
   closed at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-hierarchy-r52` with 420/0
   in Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes. So closure evidence
   now exists for the current Phase 1-4 surfaces; the remaining confidence
   gap is broader validation automation for future phases, richer knob
   sweeps, and the larger artifact-family space implied by the
   signoff-grade goal.
4. **The IR is optimized for structural legitimacy more than semantic
   richness today**
   That matches the project doctrine: whole-module intended behavior is
   usually arbitrary. The missing work is therefore not "add a
   bundled spec/oracle layer", but "add more legal, synthesizable,
   interaction-rich motifs, composition surfaces, and explicit
   expected-facts manifests where a particular artifact family needs
   them".

Taken literally against the user's `rtl_const_expr` / `rtl_frontend`
style request, the repo is **not ready yet**. It currently lacks:

- a source-level parameter / package / typedef / instantiation IR;
- frontend/elaboration fact modeling beyond the current structural
  generated-module hierarchy;
- manifest infrastructure for expected elaboration facts; and
- an artifact-family selector above the current leaf-module generator.

So the answer remains "yes as a foundation", but now with a clearer
explanation of what is missing for the broader artifact-family goal.

`ir` is a leaf. `gen` and `emit` both depend on `ir` but not on each other. This permits independent unit-testing of `emit` against hand-built IRs.

## Phase coverage map

| Phase | Status        | Code touched | Notes |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| 0 — Scaffolding              | done         | All files (initial) | Historical scaffold landed; current HEAD builds/tests/lints/formats clean again (see Build hygiene). |
| 1 — Single-module MVP        | done         | `gen/cone.rs`, `gen/module.rs`, `emit/sv.rs`, `gen/pool.rs`, `ir/types.rs`, `ir/compact.rs`, `metrics.rs` | Combinational + sequential cone recursion functional; flop worklist drained; `always_ff` emitted; single CLK + single RST_N (async). 22 structural rules enforced (Rules 1-22). Zero orphans restored at module finalisation via Rule-18 construction discipline plus `compact_node_ids`; final compaction now also drops dead flops whose `Q` is never observed, and the emitted input surface is trimmed to live ports/bits. Factorization ladder is live through a bounded `EGraph` fragment, with post-construction semantic gate merging for small-support cones, post-remap associative re-normalisation on the settled graph, a late mixed-associative-constant cleanup pass on that same settled graph, endpoint-preserving post-drain flop merging under `identity_mode = node-id`, strict Add/Mul remap-pruning under `operand_duplication_rate < 1.0`, a final exact-value cleanup pass (`fold_proven_gates`) for downstream-tool cleanliness that keeps the general exact prover tiny-only (width <= 8, support <= 10 bits, <= 3 canonical leaf endpoints) while still revisiting compare gates with the bounded unsigned-compare proof and shift gates with a bounds-only exact check, plus a tiny-domain rhs fallback for shift overshift proofs when narrow boolean-mask arithmetic keeps the rhs domain small even though the whole cone is large. Exit gate now closed locally via `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r21/tool_matrix_report.json` (1005 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, 1005/0 in Verilator and both repo-owned Yosys modes). |
| 2 — Sharing                  | done         | `gen/cone.rs`, `ir/types.rs`, `ir/compact.rs` | Per-operand `share_prob` hook wired; internal gates enter the pool as they are built. Construction-time CSE (Rule 21) + operand-uniqueness (Rule 8 extended) + commutative normalization (Rule 21b) + associative flattening + constant folding + peephole rewrites all enforced via `intern_gate`; the live bounded `EGraph` fragment now merges small-support combinational cones post-construction under `identity_mode = node-id`, duplicate flops merge post-drain when they are proven equal over the same canonical leaf endpoints by the same proof discipline, and late remaps are pruned when they would violate the strict Add/Mul duplicate policy. Final compaction cleans orphaned intermediates and dead state from these rewrites. Exit gate now closed locally via `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase2-share-r1/tool_matrix_report.json` (216 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, 216/0 in Verilator and both repo-owned Yosys modes). The representative sweep proves controllability with normalized `shared_node_fraction` rather than raw shared-node count, because stronger reuse collapses total node count. |
| 3 — Structured combinational | done         | `gen/cone.rs`, `ir/types.rs`, `emit/sv.rs`, `ir/validate.rs`, `metrics.rs`, `bin/tool_matrix.rs`, `ir/compact.rs` | Priority-encoder block (Rule 17), combinational mux block (Rule 15), procedural case-mux block (`always_comb case`), procedural casez-mux block (`always_comb casez` with non-overlapping wildcard patterns), structured bounded `for`-fold blocks (`always_comb` + `for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)` over packed chunks), generic selectable `Slice` / variadic `Concat`, coefficient motif, both shift-amount paths (`const_shift_amount_prob` plus the ordinary variable-amount path), const-comparand motif, and reduction-category gate picking are all landed. The dedicated structured-surface closure gate now exists in `tool_matrix` as `--phase3-structured-gate`, and it is closed locally via `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase3-structured-r4/tool_matrix_report.json` (210 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, 210/0 in Verilator and both repo-owned Yosys modes). The runtime hotspot that surfaced while proving that gate was addressed at the real seam: large settled cones with tiny support now skip semantic merge proofs and fall back to structural proof instead of stalling in `semantic_cone_proof`. |
| 4 — Hierarchy                | in progress  | `gen/hierarchy.rs`, `ir/types.rs`, `ir/compact.rs`, `ir/validate.rs`, `emit/sv.rs`, `main.rs`, `metrics.rs`, `bin/tool_matrix.rs` | Current live slice has the legacy exact depth-1 wrapper planner and bounded recursive planner. The wrapper lane exercises exact, reuse, and under-instantiation profiles via `num_child_instances`; the recursive lane uses `min_hierarchy_depth..=max_hierarchy_depth`, `min_child_instances_per_module..=max_child_instances_per_module`, and optional per-depth child-instance overrides. Both lanes expose explicit `hierarchy_child_source_mode = library | on-demand`, parent-side output cones over child instance outputs plus parent data ports, sibling-routed and parent-composed child-input binding, registered sibling and registered parent-composed binding through parent-local flops, parent-local child-input cones, optional local parent flops, and parent-cone helper instances for child-input, sibling-route, registered-D, and parent-output sources. The recursive lane now proves helper-through-state parent-composed routing, direct sibling helper routing, direct registered sibling helper routing, multi-stage direct registered sibling helper routing, registered parent-composed helper D-cone routing, registered parent-composed helper D-cone routing with mixed parent-port support, multi-stage registered parent-composed helper routing, parent-output helper routing, parent-output helper routing with mixed parent-port support, stateful parent-output helper routing, stateful parent-output helper routing with mixed parent-port support, unregistered parent-composed helper child-input routing with mixed parent-port support, stateful parent-composed helper child-input routing with mixed parent-port support, direct registered sibling mixed-support routing, recursive non-top direct registered sibling mixed-support routing, registered mixed-support routing, no-helper multi-stage registered parent-composed routing, no-helper multi-stage registered sibling routing, and no-helper multi-stage registered mixed-support routing below the top parent in exact-depth-2 trees. Hierarchy manifests/reports carry exact per-design `DesignMetrics`, including child-input provenance, registered/multistage/helper fractions, helper-instance budgets, parent-output helper support, helper-through-flop support, direct and stateful helper mixed-support output fractions, unregistered helper child-input mixed-support fractions, stateful helper-through-flop mixed-support child-input fractions, direct registered sibling mixed-support fractions, local parent-state counts, top-interface shape, depth histograms, per-depth branching summaries, and weighted child load. Module names are reserved from one generator-global sequence. The latest full downstream-clean repo-owned Phase 4 bank is `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-hierarchy-r52/tool_matrix_report.json` (420 designs, `coverage_gaps = []`, 420/0 in Verilator and both repo-owned Yosys modes), and it covers wrapper exact/reuse/under-instantiation, recursive depth `2`, mixed recursive depth range `2:3`, child-source modes, child-instance profiles `2`, `4`, `2:3`, `1:3`, per-depth override `0=4:4,1=2:2`, registered mixed-support routing, recursive non-top registered mixed-support routing, multi-stage registered parent-composed routing, recursive non-top multi-stage registered parent-composed no-helper routing, multi-stage registered sibling routing, recursive non-top multi-stage registered sibling no-helper routing, recursive non-top multi-stage registered mixed-support no-helper routing, recursive non-top registered parent-composed helper mixed-support routing, recursive non-top parent-output helper mixed-support routing, registered sibling routing, direct registered sibling mixed-support routing, helper-backed child-input and parent-output routing, recursive non-top helper routes, recursive non-top multi-helper budgets, local parent flops, parent-side composition, and mixed parent-port / child-output parent outputs. The current mixed-support batch includes stateful parent-composed helper child-input mixed-support metrics and Phase 4 coverage facts, with coverage-only dry-run evidence at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-stateful-helper-child-input-mixed-check/tool_matrix_report.json`. The same mixed-support batch also includes unregistered parent-composed helper child-input mixed-support metrics and Phase 4 coverage facts, with coverage-only dry-run evidence at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-parent-helper-child-input-mixed-check/tool_matrix_report.json`. The same mixed-support batch also includes stateful parent-output helper mixed-support metrics and Phase 4 coverage facts, plus required decision-site attempts for the plain `hierarchy_sibling_route_prob` knob, with coverage-only dry-run evidence at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-mixed-helper-check/tool_matrix_report.json`. `r50` superseded those coverage-only dry runs with full downstream-clean evidence, `r51` added direct registered sibling mixed-support evidence, and `r52` carries them forward while adding recursive non-top direct registered sibling mixed-support evidence. `r48` is now the previous recursive non-top registered parent-composed helper mixed-support full bank; `r49` is the previous recursive non-top parent-output helper mixed-support full bank; `r50` is the previous accumulated mixed-support hierarchy full bank; `r51` is the previous direct registered sibling mixed-support hierarchy full bank; `r52` is the latest recursive direct registered sibling mixed-support hierarchy full bank. Focused targeted evidence includes `cargo test recursive_hierarchy_parent_outputs_mix_helper_instances_with_parent_ports_below_top`, `cargo test metrics::tests::design_metrics_capture_stateful_parent_cone_instance_mixed_output_support`, `cargo test metrics::tests::design_metrics_capture_multiple_parent_cone_instance_budget`, `cargo test metrics::tests::design_metrics_capture_parent_composed_parent_cone_instance_flop_routes`, `cargo test registered_sibling_mixed_support`, `cargo test hierarchy_registered_sibling_routes_can_mix_parent_port_support`, and `cargo test recursive_hierarchy_registered_sibling_routes_can_mix_parent_port_support_below_top` alongside the earlier recursive helper and registered-route tests. Broader registered hierarchy routing/composition and future hierarchy-aware identity remain open. |

## Invariants currently enforced

In code (constructors / generator):
- `Module::intern_gate` / `intern_constant` enforce the currently-implemented combinational factorization ladder (Rule 21 / 21b / 21c): associative flattening, commutative sort on `And`/`Or`/`Xor`/`Add`/`Mul`, constant folding, peephole rewrites, then AST-cap CSE keyed by `(op, operands, width)` / `(width, value)`. `identity_mode = Relaxed` forces the effective level to `None`; `identity_mode = NodeId` uses `FactorizationLevel::effective()`, which now keeps the bounded `EGraph` fragment live at the top rung. Doctrinally, `node-id` still means full factorization (`NodeId` = expression identity); the ladder is the current build's enforcement/proof-depth dial inside that doctrine, not a competing definition of `node-id`.
- `Config::validate()` rejects out-of-range knobs.
- `Generator::new()` seeds RNG deterministically.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` produces port counts within knob ranges.
- `gen::cone::build_cone_with_retry` retries up to 4× on empty-dep-set cone roots; snapshots `m.nodes`, `m.flops`, pool, worklist, `gate_instances`, `const_instances` before each attempt and restores on empty-dep retry.
- `gen::cone::build_cone` snapshots the same state before operand construction. On anti-collapse rejection, restores the snapshot and returns `pick_terminal` as fallback. No orphan leaks from rejected recursive gates.
- `gen::cone::process_signal_frame` (interleaved) uses an existing operand as anti-collapse fallback (not `pick_terminal`) because per-gate snapshot is infeasible once sibling frames have committed.
- `gen::module::summarize_flop_mux_metadata` clears construction-only mux operand references once `flop.d` exists, so metadata-only select/data cones do not survive liveness/compaction.
- `ir::compact::merge_equivalent_gates` is the first live post-construction combinational `EGraph` fragment. It runs only under `identity_mode = NodeId` with effective level `>= EGraph`, and merges gates by endpoint-preserving proof forms: same width, same canonical primary-input / flop-Q leaf endpoints, and same currently-proven functionality. For small-support cones the proof may be semantic (bounded truth table); otherwise it falls back to the normalized structural proof. Different endpoint variables do not merge.
- `ir::compact::merge_equivalent_flops` is the first stateful extension of the NodeId-as-identity contract. It runs after D-cones exist, only under `identity_mode = NodeId` with effective level `>= Cse`, and merges flops by an endpoint-preserving proof subset: same `width`, `reset_kind`, `reset_val`, and the same D-cone proof over canonical primary-input / flop-Q endpoints. That proof is structural over the normalized IR by default, with a bounded semantic truth-table signature for small-support cones. The pass rewires duplicate Q consumers, remaps virtual flop deps, renumbers surviving flops, and rebuilds dedup tables. Different endpoint variables do not merge, even if the cone skeleton looks similar. It is still far short of coinductive sequential equivalence.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` now re-runs associative normalisation on the settled graph via `ir::compact::flatten_posthoc_associative_gates` after remap-producing passes (`fold_proven_gates`, `merge_equivalent_gates`). This keeps `nested_associative_operand_count` at zero for legal flattening opportunities and restores idempotent `And` / `Or` / `Xor` duplicate normal forms even when a later remap changes which already-built node an operand points at.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` now repairs any settled-graph output drive root whose deps have collapsed to empty after the late proof-cleanup passes. The repair swaps in a dep-bearing exact-width source (or width-adapter) before final compaction so finalized outputs stay functions of primary inputs and/or flop-Q leaves rather than trivial constants.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` runs `count_orphan_gates(m)` after the merge / before compaction as a Rule 18 safety-net audit, then `compact_node_ids`, then a second orphan audit; `m.semantic_gates_merged`, `m.flops_merged`, and `m.nodes_compacted` record the numbers of removed duplicates / unreachable nodes.
- `gen::module::shrink_primary_inputs_to_live_width` reduces each surviving primary input to the highest bit any live consumer touches; `prune_unused_input_ports` removes data-input ports with no surviving `PrimaryInput` node.
- `gen::cone::pick_terminal` prefers matching-width pool entries with non-empty deps; on no width-match, builds a width-adapter (`make_width_adapter`) from the widest dep-bearing pool entry; only emits a constant when the entire pool has empty deps.
- `gen::cone::build_cone` consults `cfg.share_prob` per operand: with that probability it calls `try_share` to return an existing matching-width pool entry (with deps, honoring `exclude`); otherwise it recurses. Fresh `Gate` nodes enter the pool on creation, so later operand decisions in the same call chain can share them.
- `gen::cone::make_width_adapter` produces a Slice (when source > target) or an exact-width Concat (when source < target), using a leading low Slice only for the remainder chunk in non-multiple expansions. Deps propagate from the source.
- `gen::cone::violates_anti_collapse` rejects duplicate operands in `And`/`Or`/`Xor` whenever the effective factorization level is `>= OperandUnique`, rejects duplicate operands in `Add`/`Mul` at the same levels when `operand_duplication_rate < 1.0`, rejects `x - x`, `x == x`, `x != x` at 2-arity, and rejects `mux(s, a, a)` when `mux_arm_duplication_rate < 1.0`. `or_reduce_terms` dedups input terms before chaining Ors; `make_none_selected` routes through it. See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 8.
- `gen::cone::pick_gate` only offers comparison ops when the parent target width is 1.
- `gen::cone::build_flop_leaf` allocates `Flop` (with random `FlopKind`) and `FlopQ` together; `Flop.q` always points at the new `FlopQ` node; `Flop.d` and `Flop.mux` are filled later by `drain_flop_worklist`.
- All flops use `ResetKind::Async` unconditionally (single-CLK / single-RST_N synchronous discipline).
- `pick_mux_arm_count` returns M from {0, 2, 3, ..., max_mux_arms}. M = 1 is excluded by design.
- `drain_flop_worklist` constructs each flop's D as one of:
  - (a) a direct recursive cone when M=0;
  - (b) one-hot mux `OR_i({N{sel_i}} & data_i)` (+ `{N{none_selected}} & Q` for `QFeedback`) for the OneHot style;
  - (c) encoded-select chained-ternary mux over `Eq(sel, k)` with a fall-through of 0 (ZeroDefault) or Q (QFeedback) for the Encoded style. QFeedback+Encoded replaces `data_0` with Q.
  The style is picked per-flop via `cfg.flop_mux_encoding_prob`. Sub-cones pass `exclude = None`: this flop's Q is a freely-reachable leaf inside its own D-cone sub-cones. See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 2 for the authoritative statement; Rule 3 covers the explicit QFeedback mux term.
- `pick_terminal_dep_bearing(g, m, pool, width, exclude)` is a strict variant of `pick_terminal`: only admits (1) a random dep-bearing matching-width pool entry or (2) a width-adapter from the widest dep-bearing pool entry. Today it is used by the retired pool-only helpers (`build_graph_first`, comb-mux / priority-encoder / const-shift pool paths) and by active paths that must force an already-existing dep-bearing source, including constant-output repair in `src/gen/module.rs` and hierarchy child-input/helper/source-selection routes in `src/gen/hierarchy.rs`. The active recursive/interleaved leaf output-cone builders still construct most internal signals through `build_cone`. Panics if the pool has no dep-bearing entry (invariant). See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 20.
- `pick_coefficient(g, width)` clamps the draw range to `[max(min_coefficient,1), min(max_coefficient, 2^W-1)]` so the emitted `width`-bit `Constant` can never overflow its declared width. Width=1 forces c=1; larger widths see the unclamped range up to `2^W-1`. See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 19.
- Associative operators (`And`, `Or`, `Xor`, `Add`, `Mul`) are N-arity with N drawn from `[cfg.min_gate_arity, cfg.max_gate_arity]` each emission. `Sub` stays strictly 2-arity (not associative). Non-operators retain their natural operand counts. See `book/src/structural-rules.md` Rule 14 and the "Operators vs blocks" preamble.
- The full catalog of enforced invariants lives in `book/src/structural-rules.md`. This file's invariants lists above are a summary with pointers to the catalog.
- `pick_terminal` filters out the excluded `NodeId` from every candidate set (matching-width, dep-bearing, fallback adapter source).
- `build_cone`, `process_signal_frame`, `grow_pool_one_unit`, `pick_terminal`, and `drain_flop_worklist` route every leaf/cone probability choice through `roll_knob`, populating `m.knob_rolls` for measurability of `flop_prob`, `comb_mux_prob`, `priority_encoder_prob`, `coefficient_prob`, `const_shift_amount_prob`, `const_comparand_prob`, `constant_prob`, `terminal_reuse_prob`, `comb_mux_encoding_prob`, `flop_mux_encoding_prob`, `share_prob`, and `flop_qfeedback_prob`. Hierarchy binding helpers separately record the hierarchy probability knobs into the same `m.knob_rolls` sink: `hierarchy_sibling_route_prob`, `hierarchy_registered_sibling_route_prob`, `hierarchy_registered_child_input_cone_prob`, `hierarchy_child_input_cone_prob`, `hierarchy_parent_cone_instance_prob`, and `hierarchy_parent_flop_prob`.
- `gen::module::generate_leaf_module` reserves port id 0 for `clk` and 1 for `rst_n`. Neither is added to the signal pool, so cones cannot terminate at them.
- `Config::validate()` still enforces the legacy exact wrapper lane
  (`hierarchy_depth ∈ {0,1}`, `num_leaf_modules >= 1` when exact
  hierarchy is enabled, `num_child_instances > 0` rejected in leaf-only
  mode), but current HEAD also validates the bounded recursive lane:
  exact legacy wrapper knobs and recursive range knobs are mutually
  exclusive, bounded ranges must satisfy `1 <= min <= max`, repeated
  `child_instances_per_depth` overrides must also satisfy
  `1 <= min <= max`, they may only target realized internal parent
  depths inside `[0, max_hierarchy_depth - 1]`, and `num_leaf_modules`
  is intentionally restricted to the legacy exact wrapper lane.

In `ir::validate::validate`:
- Operand `NodeId`s in range.
- Every drive root `NodeId` exists, and each output port has exactly
  one drive.
- Every flop table slot keeps the dense canonical relation
  `m.flops[idx].id == idx`.
- Every flop has a `d` set.
- `Flop.d`, `Flop.q`, and every `NodeId` held inside `FlopMux`
  point at live nodes.
- `Flop.q` points at `Node::FlopQ { flop: self.id, width:
  self.width }`.
- Every `Node::FlopQ` references a real flop, matches the owning
  flop's width, and is that flop's canonical `q` node.
- Output-cone root has non-empty dep-set.
- Per-gate arity: each `GateOp` variant has a fixed or variadic-with-min operand count.
- Per-gate operand widths: `And/Or/Xor/Add/Sub/Mul` / `Not` require operand width == output width; `Mux` requires sel 1-bit + two data operands at output width; `Eq/Neq/Lt/Gt/Le/Ge` require equal-width operands + 1-bit output; `RedAnd/RedOr/RedXor` require 1-bit output; `Shl/Shr` require value operand at output width (shift amount unconstrained); `Slice{hi,lo}` requires `hi >= lo`, `out_w == hi-lo+1`, source width > `hi`; `Concat` requires sum of operand widths == output width.

In `ir::validate::validate_design`:
- Every module name in `Design.modules` is unique.
- The generator now reserves module names through one global sequence,
  so hierarchy output also avoids cross-design filename collisions when
  `--count N --out DIR` emits multiple designs into the same directory.
- `Design.top` names a real module.
- Every instance references a real child module.
- Every child emitted input port is bound exactly once, at the right
  width.
- Every referenced child output port maps to a real
  `Node::InstanceOutput` of matching width in the parent; unused child
  outputs may stay unconnected.
- The module-instance graph is acyclic.

- No external Verilator / Yosys smoke tests are wired into `cargo test`
  yet. A repo-owned `tool_matrix` harness now exists for broader
  sweeps; the smoke matrix is green, the full current-code Phase 1
  gate is now closed via
  `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r21/tool_matrix_report.json`
  (1005 modules, `coverage_gaps = []`, and 1005/0 pass-fail in
  Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes), and the representative
  Phase 2 sharing gate is now closed via

  Yosys `synth -noabc`, and the repo-owned ABC path for a depth-1
  wrapper design. A focused current-code parent-composition smoke now
  exists too at `/tmp/anvil-hier-parent-compose-smoke-r1`, clean in the
  same three lanes while its manifest proves `top_parent_composed_outputs > 0`
  and `top_instance_output_dependency_fraction = 1.0`. The dedicated

  runtime evidence that the Phase 4 gate should use a
  hierarchy-focused sequential leaf profile instead of silently
  borrowing the fattest Phase 1 leaf-stress shape.

## Known weaknesses (visible in code today)

- The broader signoff-grade cleanliness matrix described in
  `ROADMAP.md` now has a repo-owned implementation in
  `src/bin/tool_matrix.rs`, and the smoke matrix is currently green:
  15/15 clean in Verilator and 15/15 clean in Yosys. The harness now
  treats warnings as failures, so "green" here means no errors and no
  warnings, not merely zero non-zero exits. The repo-owned gate surface
  now also includes the dedicated `--phase2-share-gate`, whose
  normalized `share_sweep` summary proves that stronger `share_prob`
  increases the *fraction* of shared nodes even though the raw shared
  node count falls as the graph collapses.
- `NodeId`-as-identity is still conservative for state and does not yet
  extend to future hierarchical objects. Exact-signature duplicate
  flops merge; stronger sequential/hierarchical equivalence remains open
  work.
- Phase 4 is no longer only the first depth-1 slice. The legacy exact
  wrapper lane is still real, and the repo-owned Phase 4 gate now also
  banks the current representative bounded-recursive hierarchy surface,
  including the mixed-depth recursive axis and explicit `library` vs
  `on-demand` child sourcing. Current HEAD now also has a real
  combinational sibling-routing surface, parent-composed child-input
  cone surface, parent-cone helper-instance child-input route,
  parent-cone helper-instance parent-output route,
  budgeted parent-cone helper allocation,
  registered helper-sourced child-input D cones,
  direct sibling helper routing,
  direct registered sibling helper routing,
  multi-stage direct registered sibling helper routing,
  optional local parent flops, a registered sibling-route surface that
  can now chain through earlier parent-local Qs, a registered parent-composed
  child-input route surface, and mixed parent-port / child-output
  parent outputs. Current HEAD also lets direct registered sibling routes
  mix parent-port support into the sibling/helper-backed D path without
  registered parent-composed classification. Current HEAD also lets the registered
  parent-composed child-input route mix parent data ports with sibling
  outputs and chain through earlier parent-local Qs, and lets
  parent-composed helper child-input routes consume helper-sourced
  parent-local Qs without becoming registered child-input bindings,
  including below the top parent in an exact-depth-2 recursive
  hierarchy. Direct registered sibling routing can also chain through
  earlier parent-local Qs below the top parent without helper instances
  or parent-composed D logic, and the registered mixed-support route now
  has a direct metric/proof for combining parent ports, child outputs,
  and earlier parent-local Qs below the top parent without helpers.
  Direct sibling helper routing, direct
  registered sibling
  helper routing, multi-stage direct registered sibling helper routing,
  registered parent-composed helper D-cone routing, registered
  parent-composed helper mixed-support routing, parent-output helper
  routing, parent-output helper mixed-support routing, stateful parent-output helper routing, and multi-helper budget evidence are also proved below the top parent in the recursive
  exact-depth-2 lane. These surfaces are proved
  numerically in focused smokes and the full downstream-clean `r52`
  hierarchy bank. The `r52` bank requires
  `saw_hierarchy_parent_port_composed_outputs`,
  `saw_hierarchy_registered_mixed_support_routing`,
  `saw_hierarchy_registered_sibling_mixed_support_routing`,

  `saw_hierarchy_parent_composed_parent_cone_instance_flop_mixed_support_routing`, and
  `saw_recursive_hierarchy_parent_composed_parent_cone_instance_flop_mixed_support_routing`.
  The next honest work is broader helper-instance placement beyond the current
  parent-composed child-input, stateful parent-composed child-input,
  recursive non-top stateful parent-composed child-input,
  recursive non-top direct sibling, recursive non-top direct registered
  sibling, recursive non-top multi-stage direct registered sibling,

  recursive non-top registered parent-composed helper, recursive non-top parent-output helper, recursive non-top stateful parent-output helper, recursive non-top parent-output multi-helper budget, recursive non-top child-input multi-helper budget, recursive non-top stateful multi-helper budget, direct sibling,
  direct registered sibling, registered child-input,
  budgeted parent-output helper, stateful parent-output helper, and
  multi-stage direct registered helper slices,
  broader registered
  hierarchy routing/composition where it is structurally warranted, and
  future hierarchy-aware identity.
- `emit::sv::render_gate` for `Concat` joins operand names with commas (correct SV); the IR does not currently distinguish per-operand widths in storage because every current producer of `Concat` either replicates a single source or concatenates uniform-width bits. When variadic `Concat` with mixed widths becomes a real motif, the IR shape is still adequate (widths are a property of each operand node, not of the `Concat` itself), but a generator-side helper will need to compose such shapes carefully.

## Build hygiene
- `cargo check --all-targets` — clean.
- `cargo test` — clean (305 passing tests: 197 lib + 5 main + 26 tool_matrix + 77 integration).
- `cargo build` — clean.
- `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` — clean.
- `cargo fmt --all --check` — clean.
- `mdbook build book` — clean.
- Generator-output smoke: Verilator lint on seed 42 is clean with no warning-specific suppressions beyond the usual filename noise; the previous `UNSIGNED` / `CMPCONST` tautology residue is now folded away in the IR; a default + graph-first-alias seed sweep (0..4) is clean for `UNUSEDSIGNAL`; the live `seed=0 / interleaved / relaxed / none` repro (`mod_0_0006.sv`) is now clean in both Verilator and `yosys ... synth -noabc`; the built-in `tool_matrix` smoke run is 15/15 clean in Verilator and 15/15 clean in Yosys under `--yosys-mode without-abc`; a small `--yosys-mode both` probe is now clean in both Yosys sub-modes too (`without-abc = 15/15 pass`, `with-abc = 15/15 pass`) after moving the ABC-enabled harness path to `synth -noabc; abc -fast; opt -fast; stat; check`; a same-binary fast-resume smoke on `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-resume-fast-smoke-r1` now completes cleanly both on the initial run and on the immediate `--resume` rerun, and saved checkpoints now include `runtime_fingerprint`, `sv_hash`, and `generator_checkpoint`; a real baseline `tool_matrix --phase1-gate` rerun has now been pushed to **365 generated modules** with **0 Verilator warning logs** and **0 Yosys warning lines** across the saved stdout logs (67 clean each in `int_relaxed_none_default`, `int_nodeid_none_default`, `int_nodeid_cse_default`, `int_nodeid_operand-unique_default`, and `int_nodeid_commutative_default`, plus 30 clean in `int_nodeid_associative_default` before checkpoint); the historical current-code real both-mode `tool_matrix --phase1-gate --yosys-mode both` tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r20` still stands at **570 completed module checkpoints / 571 emitted `.sv` files** with the same zero-warning bar (67 clean each in `int_relaxed_none_default`, `int_nodeid_none_default`, `int_nodeid_cse_default`, `int_nodeid_operand-unique_default`, `int_nodeid_commutative_default`, `int_nodeid_associative_default`, `int_nodeid_constant-fold_default`, and `int_nodeid_peephole_default`, plus 34 clean in `int_nodeid_e-graph_default` before intentional checkpoint); the completed current-code real both-mode `tool_matrix --phase1-gate --yosys-mode both --resume` tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r21` now has a final `tool_matrix_report.json` with **1005** completed module checkpoints / **1005** emitted `.sv` files, `coverage_gaps = []`, and the same zero-warning bar (`Verilator 1005/0`, `Yosys without-abc 1005/0`, `Yosys with-abc 1005/0`), with all **1005** saved checkpoints on `r21` already carrying the fast-resume metadata; the completed Phase 2 share-sweep tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase2-share-r1` now has a final `tool_matrix_report.json` with **216** completed module checkpoints / **216** emitted `.sv` files, `coverage_gaps = []`, and the same zero-warning bar (`Verilator 216/0`, `Yosys without-abc 216/0`, `Yosys with-abc 216/0`), while the normalized `share_sweep` summary proves the representative sharing knob sweep directly (`shared_node_fraction = 0.4122`, `0.4232`, `0.4386` at `share_prob = 0.0`, `0.3`, `0.9` respectively, alongside the expected node-count collapse); the completed Phase 3 structured-surface tree at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase3-structured-r4` now has a final `tool_matrix_report.json` with **210** completed module checkpoints / **210** emitted `.sv` files, `coverage_gaps = []`, and the same zero-warning bar (`Verilator 210/0`, `Yosys without-abc 210/0`, `Yosys with-abc 210/0`); the dedicated Phase 4 wrapper hierarchy gate is now also closed at `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase4-hierarchy-r7/tool_matrix_report.json` with **48** completed designs / **48** emitted design checkpoints, `artifact_kind = "design"`, `coverage_gaps = []`, and the same zero-warning bar (`Verilator 48/0`, `Yosys without-abc 48/0`, `Yosys with-abc 48/0`); the older depth-1 hierarchy smoke at `/tmp/anvil-hierarchy-smoke-r1` remains clean in Verilator, Yosys `synth -noabc`, and the repo-owned ABC path for a four-module emitted design (three leaves plus one top wrapper); and the newer hierarchy-metrics smoke at `/tmp/anvil-hier-metrics-smoke-r1` is also clean in the same three lanes while proving trustworthy design-level composition metrics plus the exact control-port propagation rule (`top_clock_inputs = 1`, `top_reset_inputs = 1`, `clock_fanout_instances = 5`, `reset_fanout_instances = 5`). A real partial both-mode smoke run interrupted at 14/15 scenarios was then completed successfully on the same output tree under `--resume`, ending at 15/15 clean in Verilator and both Yosys sub-modes; the legacy `r11` both-mode frontier has now been upgraded in place through **143** module checkpoints with the same zero-warning bar (67 relaxed, 67 nodeid-none, and 9 cse); after the exact-proof budget fix, a focused current-code repro (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 2 --count 10 --out /tmp/anvil-cse-seed2-repro-r1 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level cse`) now emits all 10 modules cleanly, with `fails=0` / `warns=0` under Verilator, Yosys `synth -noabc`, and the repo-owned ABC-enabled Yosys path; the stricter cleanup-proof eligibility cap is now also proven on the old `nodeid-cse` stall boundary (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 2 --count 2 --out /tmp/anvil-cse-seed2-repro-r2 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level cse`), which emits both modules cleanly under Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes; the next support-cap refinement is also now proven on the old `operand-unique` stall boundary (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 3 --count 21 --out /tmp/anvil-operand-unique-seed3-repro-r1 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level operand-unique`), which emits all 21 modules cleanly through `mod_3_0020.sv`, and all 21 are warning-clean in Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes; the next warning fix is now also proven on the first fresh-current-code `nodeid-none` boundary (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 1 --count 23 --out /tmp/anvil-nodeid-none-seed1-repro-r1 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level none`), which emits through `mod_1_0022.sv`, and all 23 modules are warning-clean in Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes; the old associative warning boundary is now also proven clean on focused current-code repros (`cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 5 --count 12 --out /tmp/anvil-associative-seed5-repro-r1 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level associative` and `cargo run --bin anvil -- --seed 5 --count 16 --out /tmp/anvil-associative-seed5-repro-r8 --construction-strategy interleaved --identity-mode node-id --factorization-level associative`), where the checked modules are warning-clean in Verilator plus both repo-owned Yosys modes; and the older `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r16` and `/tmp/anvil-tool-matrix-phase1-real-r12` trees remain historical evidence only across older code.
- `src/gen/cone.rs` now owns an always-on generator-side comparison
  proof in addition to the factorization ladder. The proof combines a
  conservative unsigned-bounds engine with an exact finite-set engine
  for comparison operands up to 8 bits wide, and it is used in every
  comparison-emission path (recursive, interleaved, pool-only, and
  constant-comparand helpers). The exact-proof helpers now also
  short-circuit on absorbing / saturating exact prefixes and duplicate
  XOR parity, so small-width exact results are not lost just because an
  irrelevant tail depends on a wider cone. That exact finite-set engine
  is now explicitly budgeted, memoizes both exact and unknown results,
  and is further capped to small-support cones (current cap: 3
  canonical leaf endpoints), so the proof remains useful on narrow
  cones without turning into a runtime trap on correlation-heavy shared
  cartesian searches. The cheap exact/bounds layer also now carries the
  reflexive arithmetic identity `x - x = 0`, because that fact must
  stay available even when the heavier finite-set prover declines a
  cone. The cheap layer also follows exact `CaseMux` and `CasezMux`
  selector arms, and falls back to conservative arm unions when the
  selector is not exact, so procedural case shapes feed the same
  warning-clean shift bounds as ternary muxes. This is an enforced
  output-cleanliness invariant, not a user
  knob.

# Memory
Compact, operational continuity snapshot. Read on session bootstrap. Keep only what is actionable.

## Current state
- **Phase:** Phase 0 done. Phase 1 (Single-module MVP) in progress; Rust-side test surface now broad.
- **Last completed slice:** inline unit tests for `src/gen/cone.rs` (6 tests: `ceil_log2`, `pick_mux_arm_count`, `make_width_adapter` edge cases) and `src/emit/sv.rs` (6 tests: module header, conditional clk/rst_n, always_ff shape, operator/constant rendering, Slice/Concat, Mux ternary). Total: 20 unit + 2 integration = 22 tests. See `CHANGES.md` entry `2026-04-15-0009`.
- **Next up:**
  1. Verilator-lint smoke when `verilator` is locally available, or wire CI to provide it. This is the remaining Phase 1 exit gate.
  2. After Verilator-lint green: declare Phase 1 done and start Phase 2 (signal sharing / DAG cones).
  3. Optional hardening before Phase 2: inline unit tests for `assemble_flop_d_encoded` and `assemble_flop_d_one_hot` (currently only exercised indirectly through the integration sweep).

- `5f6022f` — Initial scaffold + Phase 1 cone-adapter hardening.

## Open questions / deferred decisions
- Constant-probability value — current default `0.1` is a guess; tune after Phase 1 seed sweeps.
- Whether the IR should use `typed-arena` or stay on `Vec<Node>` with `u32` indices. Current choice: plain `Vec`, because it's simple, cache-friendly, and `serde`-friendly.
- The lazy adapter currently picks the *widest* pool entry with deps. Random-among-eligible may give better motif coverage; revisit after Phase 1 metrics.
- `flop_prob` default `0.15` is a guess; calibrate after the first synthesis smoke run that reports flop counts vs gate counts.
- `max_flops_per_module` cap of `32` is conservative. May raise once metrics show generation time is not bottlenecked by D-cone draining.
- `flop_mux_encoding_prob` default `0.5` is equal-motif; no empirical data yet. Bias once synthesis metrics show which style catches more bugs.
- Ternary-over-`case` for the Encoded mux SV form — see `DEVELOPMENT_NOTES.md` rejected-alternatives; revisit when/if FSM motifs force procedural block emission.

## Known gaps vs `ROADMAP.md`
- Phase 1 exit criterion (1000 modules through Verilator + Yosys) not yet met locally; tools missing.
- Concat / Slice are used by the adapter and the flop emitter, but `input_widths_for(Concat|Slice, ...)` is still a placeholder. They are not selectable by `pick_gate` in Phase 1, so the placeholder is dead code today.
- Sharing (DAG cones), structured ops (case, for-loop), hierarchy, parameterization: not started.

## Session handoff notes
- All design decisions discussed so far are captured in `book/src/core-idea.md`, `book/src/why-not-grammar.md`, `book/src/non-triviality.md`, and `book/src/non-goals.md`. Read those before proposing structural changes.
- `COMMIT.md` is strict. Follow it exactly. `git_message_brief.txt` must stay untracked.
- The generator's "by construction" contract is load-bearing. Any PR that adds a generate-then-filter step (aside from the bounded retry in `cone::build_cone_with_retry`) is a design regression.
